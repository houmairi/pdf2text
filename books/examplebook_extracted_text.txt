~ About This Book ~ 
 
Cooking by the Book  was put together as a labor of love by more than two dozen talented 
writers  who just happen to be wonderful cooks as well. The main goal in this undertaking was to offer loyal readers and website visitors a gift to show our appreciation.   During the process of completing this project, all of the writers took great pains to fill this little e-book with favorite recipes, short biographies, and even some excerpts from the books that tie in with the appetizing foods you'll find listed.   As you read through the finished cookbook, we hope you discover many delicious recipes, learn a little about each author, and be tempted to sample a few of the dishes  and at least a little of our writing.  A lot of effort went into completing this offering. The driving force behind it, and the person who got the ball rolling, is a gifted author by the name of Kathleen Walls. She served as contact, editor, planner, and even finished the attractive cover for thefinished e-book. A number of other writers put on their editors' hats to help out, including Dehanna Bailee, Phyllis Cambria, Charlotte Dillon, Leslie P. Garcia, Peggy Hazelwood, and Ann Josephson. Other authors, like Carol Kluz and David Leonhardt stepped forward to handle promotion.  Enjoy!

EMMA BRANDENBERGS VICTORIAN CREAM SCONES 
 
Setting the Scene:  
 
  In the summer of 1897, Emma Brandenberg seems to be living the pampered life of late-Victorian wealth. Her much-older husband, Philip, is the popular mayor of Hollybrook, Massachusetts; she resides in a beautiful home and dines on the finest of foods; and no one, not even her closest friends, ever hears her complain of unhappiness.  
Yet behind closed doors Philip is a controlling and often-abusive monster - and it 
will take a nomadic stranger to uncover the truth about the Brandenbergs gilded lives...and to teach Emma about liberation. Indulge yourself in the luxury of Emma Brandenbergs Victorian Cream Scones with a tantalizing taste from Catherine  Karps  
novel, GILDED . ISBN: 0738825530  
 
Excerpt from GILDED:  
 
  Within a matter of minutes, the house became inundated with the bellowing tones of masculine voices and laughter. Philip lured his guests into the parlor to the immediate right of the entry hall and made them all comfortable in his Vanderbilt-worthy palace. The men seated theirbacksides on the Brandenbergs velvet, consuming the rich sights of the elegant room around them and raising their nostrils to the aroma of fresh coffee and freshly baked pastries. By a quarter past the hour, all of the gentlemen had arrived and settled into the parlor. Nora brought out the teacart laden with scones and cakes and served the coffee with Emmas assistance.  
Emma Brandenbergs Victorian Cream Scones  
 
Ingredients: 
1 cup flour  
2 T sugar ½ tsp salt  3 tsp baking powder  ¼ cup cold unsalted butter, sliced into pieces ½ cup currants or raisins  2 beaten eggs ½ cup cream  
 9 
Topping: 
2 T sugar 
½ tsp cinnamon 
 
Instructions: 
For best results, keep ingredients as cold as possible during preparation. Sift dry 
ingredients and add butter. Stir in currants or raisins (other dried fruits may be substituted). Combine the eggs and cream in a separate bowl and add to the flour mixture. Blend the batter until smooth. Pat into a mound measuring ¾-inch thick. Cut  into triangles and sprinkle with the sugar/cinnamon topping. Bake for about 20 minutes in a preheated 375° F oven until lightly brown. Serve traditionally with jams, lemon curd, or Devonshire cream or get creative. Makes about 1 dozen.   
Authors Bio:

 OLD-FASHIONED JOHNNY CAKE 
 
Setting the Scene:  
 
     The simplicity of pioneer cooking often fascinatesus as we try to re-create some of the recipes of the early settlers. These take us back to earlier times and encourage us to read stories and do research about the lives of the pioneers. Stores werent readily available without traveling long distances tothe nearest town, so settlers had to be self-sufficient and raise most of what they needed. So they picked and dried berries for winter food, raised pumpkins, beans and squash, ate wild game, and caught fish in the streams. We can still enjoy these simple recipes today. Whip up some old-fashioned johnny cakes to enjoy with an excerpt from TALES OF ADVENTURE AND DISCOVERY (ISBN: 0-
9651675-0-X). 
 Excerpt from TALES OF ADVENTURE AND DISCOVERY: 
  
  Sarah Jane picked up the bucket of blackberries and started toward the cabin. Suddenly Tag barked and ran to the far side of the berry patch.     
Tag, come back, Sarah Jane called. But Tag continued barking. Then Sarah 
Jane heard someone yell. She rushed through the berry patch, her blond braids with the red yarn tied on the ends flying out behind her. She stopped suddenly when she saw Tag. He was standing beside a native girl who lay on the ground. The girl was about ten years old, the same as Sarah Jane.     
What are you doing here? Sarah Jane asked as she approached the girl 
cautiously. The Indian girl looked at Sarah Jane but said nothing. She got up, only to fall when she put her weight on her right foot.      
Later Sarah Janes mother offered the native girl biscuits and milk. Since 
cornmeal and wheat flour were the most commonly used in pioneer days, cornmeal griddlecakes or corn bread baked in a pan over the coals may have been what Sarah Janes mother referred to as biscuits. 
 
OLD FASHIONED JOHNNY CAKE  Ingredients: 
Sift together: 
1 cup yellow cornmeal 2 cups sifted flour ½ cup sugar (less if you dont want it so sweet) 1 tsp salt 
 113 tsp baking powder 
Rub in a piece of butter, egg size, or about 2 T  
Instructions: 
Stir in 1 beaten egg and 1-1/2 cups sweet milk; batter may be slightly lumpy. Turn into 
greased 8 by 8-inch baking pan; bake about ½ hour at 375° F. or until inserted pick comes out clean. (In pioneer days, they might stir in some dried berries before baking.)

PLAIN MUFFINS 
  
Setting the Scene:  
 
     When my mother, who was stricken with Alzheimers disease, resided in a nursing home, my grandchildren (her great-grandchildren) enjoyed visiting her with me, even though she didnt recognize us. One of the treats consisted of tea parties with Great Grandma Dee Dee. This is a tradition I started whenever I visited, a family tradition of sitting over tea and chatting when we visited my grandmothers home and later my mom in her home. Mother, while in the nursing home, seemed to find these occasions relaxing. She particularly enjoyed muffins, whether we made them ourselves or purchased them at a fast food restaurant. Sometimes we made my mother-in-laws blueberry cake and took this for our tea parties. Share another family tradition by making the plain muffins I made as a youngster, or add extra ingredients to make them fancy enough for any tea party. Then have a muffin as you read an excerpt fromCan Children Cope with Alzheimers Disease, from WHEN WE BECOME THE PARENT TO OUR PARENTS (ISBN: 
09651675-1-8).  
 Excerpt from WHEN WE BECOME THE PARENT TO OUR PARENTS:  
  
    Kara looks forward to these tea parties.      
You sit near your mommy, she says [to me] and points to the chair 
nearest Mother. Then she pulls up a chair for herself and chatters while we eat.      
Mother seems unaware of the relationship between Kara and herself. She 
no longer recognizes me, or if she does, cant verbalize it. But Mother does know that a little girl visits; she comments on the nice little girl here today.      
Mother no longer can feed herself. Kara takes it for granted that I will give Great 
Grandma bites of muffin and sips of tea. These visits give the Alzheimers patients life significance, as they help their grandchildren and great grandchildren understand the various phases of life with love and compassion. 
 
PLAIN MUFFINS  Ingredients: 
2 cups sifted flour 
3 tsp baking powder ½ tsp salt 3 T melted shortening 2 to 3 T sugar, depending on desired sweetness 
 
 13Instructions: 
Sift the dry ingredients together. Stir together the milk, egg and the melted shortening. 
Add the liquid ingredients to the dry mixture, stirring only until mixed. Batter will be somewhat lumpy. With a tablespoon, drop batter into muffin tins lined with muffin papers; fill 2/3 full. Bake at 400° F for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the size muffin.  
VARIATIONS:   
Add ½ to 1 cup floured blueberries to the batter. 
Sprinkle cinnamon sugar mixture over the top. Stir in ½ cup raisins or currants. Stir in ½ cup chocolate chips. Chopped nuts can be added with any of the variations. Add ½ cup chopped cranberries. Add 1 T grated orange peel.

FRUMENTY 
 Setting the Scene: 
 
           After setting out lunch at the medieval charity fair, our heroine, Janet, is roped into making supper. Meanwhile, Devin, is getting beaten at a sword fight against Silas, the man who constantly drools over Janet's cleavage. Afraid she's the prize, Janet is almost too scaredto watch. 
 
Excerpt from All for a Good Cause:  
 
Scowling, Janet took another swig of the beer she was supposed to use for the 
meat marinade. After stepping out of her hoops back in Devin's trailer, she'd sought out Maggie-Ann and for her efforts got roped into setting out lunch. And starting supper. Her slippers, soaked by the dew, were out drying in the sun behind the kitchen tent. She decided to risk dropping a clay pot or two on her toes. 
"So where did you go this morning?" Maggie-Ann asked her, whisking a bowl of 
cream. 
"I had trouble with my hoops and needed a private place to fix them. I didn't want 
to disturb you and Tom." 
"You missed breakfast. We had frumenty, and the boys actually liked it. Stop 
drinking the marinade." 
Janet put down her tumbler of beer. "Just checking it. Besides, I need something 
to get me through the weekend. I'm going to be married tomorrow and my betrothed is being beaten to a pulp by the sheriff." 
Maggie-Ann peered out at the practice field. "Good God, is he ever. If I didn't 
know better, I'd say Silas was enjoying it. Maybe you're the prize." 
"If I am, I'm going home." "Don't want to marry Silas?" Maggie-Ann asked. "The thought turns my stomach." "Maybe it's all the beer you're swilling. Get the meat into it, before it's all gone, 
will you? You're making supper, remember?" 
Janet dumped the huge seasoned roast into the clay pot she'd swiped 
with grease. Almost crying, she dumped the beer into it.   
 15 
FRUMENTY  
 
Ingredients: 
1 cup of cracked wheat 
3 cups of water or milk Honey  Cream  
Instructions: 
Simmer the cracked wheat in the water or milk until tender and the consistency of 
oatmeal, about 20 minutes. Serve into bowls, add a tsp of honey and cover with cream. Pour cold water into empty pot to aid in clean up. Serves 6.  True, old-fashioned frumenty, a breakfast dish, takes hours to cook, but this version is just as tasty. Cracked wheat is available in health or bulk food stores. Try adding your favorite dried fruit in the last few minutes for a special treat.  
Author's Bio: 
 
       After Barbara Phinney  retired from the military, she decided to tackle something 
she knew nothing about, romance writing. And so her second career was born. Shortly after, she was asked by her local newspaper to write a humorous slice-of-life column. She wrote that until she moved to Canada's East Coast. She says writing romance has helped her to see the world differently. "Everyone has goals and motives. Understanding them helps me deal with those around me."        Barbara's romantic comedy, All For A Good Cause , is available as an e-book at Hard 
Shell Word Factory's website, www.hardshell.com
. Barbara lives with her husband, two 
children and an ancient cat. You can contact her about her novel at barbarap@nbnet.nb.ca

BEEF JERKY 
 
Praise for ACROSS THE SWEET GRASS HILLS: 
 
With three-dimensional characters and passion for her story, Gail Jenner 
authentically recreates the raw and rugged world of Montana in the late 1800s. 
~ Jane Kirkpatrick, ALL TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE  
  The words she has written sing, her research is extraordinary, and the plot 
mesmerizes. 
~Vella Munn, BLACKFEET SEASON  
 Set against an authentic background, written by an author with the soul of a poet, 
this debut historical romance speaks, in a lyrical voice, of a love that transcends the hate, fear, and ugliness of the bloody cultural clash between white and Native Americans in the 1860s and 1870s. 
~ Patricia Lucas White, P.S., IVE TAKEN A LOVER   
Excerpt from ACROSS THE SWEET GRASS HILLS: 
 
RedEagle extended the butt end of his knife, teasing her with flashing eyes. Liza 
took the knife, turning it in her hands. It was made of horn, perhaps elk or deer. The blade was broad, sharp, and deadly. For a moment, she wondered if Red Eagle had ever used it on a man. Stifling the thought, she knelt beside him, eyes averted. She didnt want to look into this mans eyes; they seemed to look through her, and she feared Red Eagle would see the apprehension and anxiety in her face. Liza timidly reached for the slab of red meat, grimacing at the blood that ran down her fingers. Do what I do, Liza, he instructed quietly, attention diverted by the way shed begun cutting the meat. Liza frowned, seeing that her slices of jerky meat were thick, not thin. But she would learn all that this half-breed could teach her. Having always relied on her father and brothers, she now had to rely on herself.

Hank has promised to cook her a Cajun gumbo in his apartment over his rehab center. The cooking has beeninterrupted when Hank stops to register a young addict wanting help in the center. 
 
Excerpt from LAST STEP: 
 
After answering a few more of Annies questions, he took her back to Hilda to 
start her classes. He then escorted Vickie back to his apartment. Sorry to have our day interrupted like that but that girl needed help. I hope she makes it.    
  She seems so sincere, Vickie replied. 
 
Well do our best. The rest is up to her. He changed the subject. Lets start that 
gumbo. Im starved. Make yourself useful, woman. Ill peel the shrimp; you cut up the okra and onions.  
He got out a cutting board and knife for her. When their fingers touched, Vickie 
felt the familiar tingle. She knew he did, too, but he turned away and busied himself getting a large black iron pot and setting it on the stove.  
The meal was delicious. They carried on a conversation about Saturdays plans. 
Both were conscious of the contained feelings in the room. Vickie knew that Hank had only to make a slight move in her directionand they would end up in bed. Hank restrained himself. He took her back to the hotel but made no move to accompany her to her room.  
 
Hanks Cajun Gumbo  
 
Ingredients: 
1 lb fresh shrimp 
1 lb crab meat (whole boiled, cleaned crab or crab claws can be substituted) 1 lb fresh okra (frozen cut okra can be used) 1 medium onion 1 medium bell pepper 2 stalks of celery 
 212 cloves garlic 
1 tsp Cajun Seasoning 1 tsp File (if available) 3 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped (a can of cooked tomatoes can be substituted) 16 oz can tomato sauce Salt to taste 3 T olive oil 4 cups water (more can be added if gumbo becomes too thick)  
Instructions: 
Peel shrimp. Cut okra into slices. Chop onion, bell pepper and celery coarsely. Sauté 
onions, peppers and celery in oil in large pot (old cast iron pot is best). When onions start to become translucent, add okra. Cook until it loses its sliminess then add shrimp. Peel and chop garlic and add to pot. When shrimp turn pink, add tomatoes, sauce, water and seasoning. Bring to boil and then simmer about 20 minutes. Add crab. Simmer 5 more minutes.  Serve over fluffy white rice in a bowl. This thick rich soup is a winter favorite in Cajun country. This is an adaptable meal; oysters can be added when you add the crab. Some people also add sausage. A Cajun host always offers food, so if unexpected company comes, just add water to stretch this gumbo.

 22MAGICALLY DELICIOUS ROAST BEEF PO-BOYS 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
In MISTER MAGIC , Candace owns an isolated inn in Louisiana. Lance is a 
famous magician who has been accused of everything from Satanic worship to murder. Will a month with Lance cost Candace more than her heart?  
Excerpt from MISTER MAGIC : 
 
Candace walked into the empty lobby and knelt next to the tabloid papers Lance 
had thrown across the room. She picked one of them up. There was a photo on the front page that had supposedly been taken in Lances Los Angeles home. The bed in the picture was covered with black satin sheets. Two skull-shaped candles sat on a table on either side of it. A large circle with a strange looking star inside of it had been painted on the wall above the head of the bed. Candace knew the article inside the paper went into detail about the fact that the circle had been painted with blood. She had already read all about it when she was in town. 
It makes quite interesting reading. Wouldnt you say, Candace? 
 
She looked up to find Lance watching her, his green eyes narrowed and angry. 
She wadded the paper up as she stood and walked over to the front desk, where she threw it in the wastebasket where trash belonged. She didnt believe the story. Not after spending the last few days with Lance, not after overhearing the heated conversation he had with Mr. Walker. Besides, this was real life, not some spine-tingling novel by Stephen King. People didnt make packs with Satan in the real world.  
Id have to agree that its interesting, but then Ive always preferred reading 
fiction, she said with a smile. After all, its usually a lot more excitin than the truth. Lance slowly returned her smile. Well, come on, I have supper waiting. Roast beef po-boys. 
 
MAGICALLY DELICIOUS ROAST BEEF PO-BOYS  Ingredients: 
1 lean eye-of-round roast (Size depends on how many people you are feeding. Warning:  
southerners tend to eat twice as much as others, so keep that in mind when figuring amount needed.) Flour Salt Black Pepper Red Pepper (Be careful. This stuff is hotter than a love scene!) Beef Bouillon Cubes Packaged Brown Gravy Mix Oil 
 23Favorite Seasonings 
French Bread Lettuce Tomatoes 
 
Instructions: 
Season your roast with salt and pepper. You can also use meat tenderizer, a type of 
season all, onion and garlic powder, or whatever seasonings you like. Once the seasonings are rubbed in well, roll the roast in flour. Heat about ½ inch of oil in a large pot, then brown the roast on all sides. When the roast is very well browned, add enough water to the pot to just cover the meat. Add a coupleof beef bouillon cubes. Add salt, pepper, and other favorite seasonings to the water, then cover, lower the fire and simmer for a couple of hours.  After 2 hours, remove the roast and place it on a cutting board to cool some. Next slice and cut the roast up into thin bite-size pieces. Return meat to liquid in pot, stir in a couple of packs of brown gray mixcan be the kind that comes with onion bits or mushrooms. Let the mixture and the meat simmer for another hour on low, stirring occasionally to make sure the gravy doesnt stick to the bottom of the pot.  To serve, slice off a piece of French bread about 5 inches long. Slice it in half, so you have a top and bottom for your sandwich. Spoon meat and gravy over the bottom slice, then place sliced lettuce and tomatoes on top of the roast. Take the top piece of French bread and coat it with plenty of mayonnaise, then place it on top of the lettuce and tomatoes. Now you have a real southern dressed roast beef po-boy. (Note. All good roast beef po-boys are really messy, so plenty of paper towels should be at hand.)

  Charlotte Dillon  was born in Louisiana. As a child she feared bedtime, when the 
lights were turned out and her room settled into darkness. There was a way not to notice the slow movement that she could swear was near her closet, or the soft breaths that she could almost hear under her bedmake up a story. Each night, while she waited for sleep to come, she invented characters, designed worlds, and slipped away from the darkness and her childish fears. 
 As an adult, Charlotte  still makes up bedtime tales, but now she has a perfect

GARBAGE POTATO SALAD 
 
Excerpt from TRUE NATURE:  
 
Olivia placed the tomatoes in a colander on the table and took one out. She took 
the knife from Kailen and deftly removed the stem and sliced it into many perfect pieces. Smiling her toothless grin, she popped the last piece in her mouth. 
 Your treat, she cackled. You work on these. I will get you a plate. Then I can 
start on the lettuce. 
 The woman headed back into the cooler leaving Kailen with a colander full of 
tomatoes and no idea what to do. She picked up the first tomato and proceeded to cut them as the woman had showed her. 
 Olivia shuffled back into the kitchen and took an educated glance at Kailens 
handiwork. 
 
A bit thinner than that dear, or that will be all you taste. 
 
The woman drew another knife from the block and deftly began to chop up the 
heads of lettuce. She explained her technique and the reason she did certain things, walking back to the simmering pots on the stove to stir them every once and a while and then returning to the lettuce. She filled the colander with chopped lettuce and took it to the sink to rinse. 
 Kailen was surprised at the womans energy and complete ease in her own 
domain. She felt immediately as if the woman was like family, and began to talk with her more; asking questions about what she was cooking and her favorite recipes and such. 
 When she had finished the tomatoes and cleaned off her workplace, Olivia placed 
a full plate of food in front of her, and smiled. 
 
See there, lady, she spoke softly, You work, you eat. Not so bad now. 
 
Olivia patted her arm, turned and left the kitchen, leaving Kailen alone with a 
huge pile of food and the warmth of a good solid woman.  
Garbage Potato Salad 
 
Ingredients: 
6 cups of potatoes (red, white, and/or yellow) 
½ good-sized onion (diced) 1 medium tomato (diced) ½ green pepper (diced) 
 252 stalks of celery (diced) 
2 hard boiled eggs ¼ cup minced raw carrots ¾ cup Miracle Whip (or mayonnaise) ¼ cup mustard 2 T bacon bits Chili powder or paprika Salt Pepper Celery leaves or parsley.  
Instructions: 
Wash fresh ingredients. Cube potatoes (do not peel) into 1- or 2-inch pieces. Add to 
stockpot and bring to boil. Cook until you tender (can pierce with a fork, but not so long they are mushy). Drain in colander and set aside to cool. Dice onion, pepper, celery, tomato, and add into large bowl. Add minced carrots. Chop one egg, and add to bowl. Add potatoes, mayonnaise, bacon bits, and mustard and mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the salad is too pasty, you can add small amounts of mayonnaise and mustard tosoften the blend. You want to try to keep it chunky. When finished, scoop salad into serving dish and with a wet spoon, flatten surface. Slice the last egg long-wise into ovals. Place on top of salad in a flower shape and garnish with parsley or celery leaves, and chili powder/paprika.  This very colorful salad provides a hearty addition to any meal. It is also a nice item to prepare to bring to a potluck or cook out. Ingredients are variable and you can modify to your own tastes and preferences. Go ahead; bring some trash to dinner.

I learned how to make potato salad from my Mother who lives in Abita Springs, 
Louisiana. It was a staple around our house, and everyone loved Miss Jeannes cooking. I can remember the large gatherings every weekend with family and friends filling the household. The women took it upon themselves to make sure there was more than an abundance of food to eat. I believe that you get your best recipes from those who have come before. ~ Dehanna Bailee

 BECKY'S SALAD 
 
Excerpt from A MONTANA FAMILY : 
Veterinarian Dana Hathaway is raising two kids and trying to keep her ranch in 
the blackno easy task after the death of her husband three years ago. A meddling mother, matchmaking best friend, and a neighboring rancher with the hots for heror could it be her ranch?make her life complicated. But when her old high school flame Zach returns to Fossil Hill, Colorado, things change from challenging to downright dangerous. 
Undercover DEA Special Agent Zach Forrestor is on medical leave, and has 
brought his newfound niece to this small Colorado town hoping to keep her safe. But an old enemy follows him and threatens all he cares abouthis late sister's child, and the newly-rekindled love he'd never hoped to regain. 
In the midst of old emotions and very real danger, Dana doesn't have much time 
for complicated menu planning. This salad, however, is one that wins Zach's heart.

Setting the Scene: 
 
Dorothy Gale Robinson, an aspiring actress, is the daughter of hippie parents with 
a passion for old movies. When her father is killed suddenly while sipping a non-fat decaf mocha latte at a local coffee shop, Dorothys life is turned upside down. When Dorothys mother decides to sell all her worldly possessions and join a New Age cult headquartered in Banff, Canada, Dorothy, her boyfriend, Lahrs, and a cult-buster, Mervyn ORoy venture from Florida to Canada to recover Dorothys mother from the clutches of the New Age cult. In this scene, Dorothy and Lahrs decide to dine at Ed Wongs, a restaurant serving both Chinese and authentic Canadian cuisine. 
 
Excerpt from Hey Dorothy Youre Not in Kansas Anymore:  
 
The Asian man seated us at the window and handed us each a menu - which was 
only a small laminated sheet of paper. I didnt see any Canadian cuisine listed. When the Asian man came back to take our order, I asked him about the Canadian food. We have Alberta beef, he said. You like beef? I make you some Alberta beef. Its so goooo-d. 
 
Does anything come with it? I asked. 
 
We have rice. You like rice? We have steamed rice and fried rice. The fried rice 
is so goooo-d. 
Is that the only Canadian dish you have? 
 
You dont like beef? This is the best - Alberta beef. You like - you see. Ill make 
some for you. And you take some fried rice. And you sir, you like some Alberta beef? Is so goooo-d. 
Lahrs said, I think Ill try the sweet and sour chicken. Is that Alberta chicken? 
 
This sweet and sour chicken. Its so goooo-d. You see. You will like. And you 
like some fried rice, too? 
 
Yeah. Okay, said Lahrs. 
 
The Asian Man hurried away with our orders. A few seconds later a young 
woman came out and served us water and hot tea. So much for their authentic Canadian cuisine, I said. 
 
You not like Alberta beef? Lahrs said, imitating the waiter.  
 29Well find out. 
 You think many people eat here? 
 
They cant have too many customers, I said. There are only six tables. I 
hope the food really is so goooo-d. 
 
Me, too. Im starving.

 30NANNYS CREAMED POTATOES 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
From THE MAGIC OF PATCHWORK,  we learn about quiltmaking of days ago 
and that social event, the quilting bee, when women got together, sewed, chatted, and enjoyed one anothers food. Even today, quiltmakers gather to sew, learn from one another, and enjoy each others company over tea and goodies. I remember quilting with my grandmother when I was eight years old, making a quilt for my bed, which I still have today, even though its well worn. Then instead of quilting the quilt, Nanny, my aunt and a neighbor lady tied the quilt. I was so pleased they allowed me to participate. My granddaughter, at age ten, has been learning to make a quilt this summer.  
Excerpt from The Magic of Patchwork: 
 
The magic of patchwork has captivated women for decades making it one of our 
American crafts achieving status as an art form. . .  
The Quilting Bee  - One of the enjoyable aspects of quiltmaking in days ago was 
the quilting bee. The ladies met to put a quilt together after the top had been pieced or appliquéd. This was one of the social activities in pioneer times. They arrived at the hostess home in the morning, bringing their needles and thread. They spent the day chatting and quilting. Often they exchanged quilt patterns and displayed samples of a quilt they were working on. Sometimes the ladies brought pies or cakes and the hostess prepared a meal. Frequently in the evening, the men folk joined them at the hostess home. There would be a supper, perhaps some games and dancing. This was a way new people in the area got acquainted and long-time residents socialized. 
Nannys Creamed Potatoes 
 This very simple dish may have been served for supper at a quilting bee. It made use of leftover boiled potatoes and was one my grandmother and mother often made. My mother served it once when my in-laws visited, and my mother-in-law raved about it long afterward.  
Ingredients: 
Boiled potatoes, diced 
Butter 1 T flour Whole milk or cream to cover potatoes Salt Pepper Onion, diced (optional) Fresh parsley, chopped, or paprika  
 31Instructions: 
Dice leftover, cooked boiled potatoes. Place potatoes in iron skillet, called a spider by 
Nanny. (Any heavy frying pan or an electric skillet will do.) Add a dab of butter (home churned on Nannys farm); sprinkle 1 T flour over the potatoes. Pour in whole milk or cream to just cover potatoes. Add salt and pepper as desired. Cook slowly over medium heat until potatoes are warmed through and milk has thickened. Sometimes Mother diced an onion into the potatoes before cooking. In season, she chopped fresh parsley over the top or sprinkled with paprika. Some cooks like to stir in ¼ cup finely shredded cheese just before serving.

 SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Dill, a chef, recently separated from the woman he couldnt imagine being 
without, is remembering how Willa, aforementioned woman, taught him that the best remedy for the blues is good food. 
 
Excerpt from NEARVANA: JUST SOUTH OF NIRVANA:  
 
When Willa took one half of their double-wide trailer and headed north from 
Oregon on I-5, Dill took the other half and went south, toward Nirvana, New Mexico.    Dill loved green chilies.    He could love New Mexico.  
Trailers dont travel well cross-country though. That is how Dills half, the Cafe, 
came to land in Near-Vana, just south of Nirvana. Dill decided it was about as good a name for his cafe as any, so it stuck.   
Cafe NearVana.  These days Dill stands in front of his trailer, stroking the outside wallright 
there, where Willas half used to be joined to his, half-believing it to still be there. Feeling it, like a missing limb. 
 Thinking of Willa makes Dill hungry. When she wanted to make him feel happy, 
she would cook dinner and dessertrecipes that had always brought her comfort when she was down, before Dill. They were not low-cal, low-fat, meager-portioned meals, but full-bodied, warming, fill-you-up-you-are-not-alone dinners. And she was right. He always felt better. As a Chef, he knew it wasnt healthy, but as a man, a husband, and a human being, he could think of no better remedy for the blues. 
 Willa called me her sweet potato. The first time she made this dish for me, we 
talked about having our own little sweet potatoes. You know, children. 
 33

SWEET-N-HOT CABBAGE 
 
Setting the Scene:  
 
TRUE NATURE  is set in Louisiana. In the following excerpt, Kailen is touring 
historic New Orleans. The tour guide takes her along historic St. Charles Avenue, to the zoo, and over the Mississippi river before stopping in a small restaurant to sample the famous fare the city is known for. 
 
Excerpt from TRUE NATURE: 
 
Kailen stared in awe at the tree-lined avenues they traveled on, admiring the 
ancient oaks that stretched their long branches across the streaming traffic in a timeless embrace. The green trolleys rattled and hummed down the tracks, clicking with a steady rhythm as their wheels passed through intersections, and falling strangely silent for a moment as they paused on their journey to pick up a passenger or two. She thought she would come back later in the week to ride one.  
Passing the park with a zoo, she watched the many families enjoying the weather 
there with each other. She saw one family with a little girl sitting on her fathers shoulders holding a bright red balloon while they strolled beneath the green canopy and it made her ache as she thought of home briefly.  
As the tour made it out to another of the great bridges that spanned the mighty 
river, she felt a stirring of nostalgia, really beginning to understand how old this city really was.  
Heading out again, the tour briefly stopped at a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant 
to eat lunch. She watched as a seemingly endless palette of colors and smells were offered to whet her appetite, and she ended up eating more than sheshould have, but enjoyed every bite.  
The food here was so much different from that which she grew up with, the new 
textures and flavors triggering taste buds she did not even know existed. Again, Kailen fleetingly thought of her family back in the Appalachia, knowing that they would probably not believe that she was eating food like this. 
 
Sweet-n-Hot Cabbage  Ingredients: 
1 head cauliflower 
1 head cabbage 1 good-sized onion 4 large tomatoes 
 351 green pepper 
¾ cup water ½ cup butter or margarine (optional) 1 T Texas Pete or Tabasco (adjust to personal taste) 5 T sugar (adjust to personal taste) Salt Pepper  
Instructions: 
Chop cabbage, cauliflower, tomato, onion and green pepper. Add all chopped items into 
large stockpot and add water. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower heat. Add butter, hot sauce, and sugar. Simmer ingredients for at least thirty minutes or until cabbage and cauliflower is tender, and water has reduced. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot or cold. Keeps well if covered in refrigerator. This side dish can be served either hot or cold, and also makes a wonderful in between meal as well. 
 
Authors Bio: 
 
This recipe is a delightful twist on the plain-old cabbage dish that was passed 
down to me from my mother-in-law, Ms. Linda from Beckley, West Virginia. I have to admit that in the past, cabbage has not been my ingredient of choice for cooking, but I have enjoyed cooking and serving this dish to both my family and guests. It has a smooth bite with a pleasing aftertaste that will surprise most people who try this dish for the first time. Bon appetite! ~ Dehanna Bailee

 36MOLLYS GEORGIA FRIED GREEN TOMATOES 
 
Excerpt from Georgias Ghostly Getaways:  
 
Fortunately for the modern traveler, Milledgeville managed to preserve much of 
its antebellum architecture and flavor. You can still tour The Old Governors Mansion, one of the Souths best examples of Greek Revival architecture. St. Stephens Episcopal Church, where Shermans soldiers stabled their horses, is still in use as a house of worship. The tale of a child who got the pipe organ replaced after Federal troops poured molasses into the original organ is a case of fact being more interesting than fiction.  
The Old Governors Mansion seems to have multiple spirits. There is Molly, who 
spent her life as the cook. Delicious smells emanate from the basement kitchen although the huge red brick fireplace is no longer used for cooking. When you tour the mansion you may witness unusual phenomena. Others have. At a tour in 1992, all the lights flickered as if keeping time to unheard music. Workers have heard footsteps and even seen apparitions. Servants tell of beds being unmade by spirits after the room is cleaned. In an interview with James C. Turner, the curator of the Mansion, he stated  This was a house of life and death. Governor Browns younger brother, John Brown, returned here in 1864 severely wounded in battle. He died here and was laid out in the rotunda. From time to time people have heard him groaning in his pain. Likewise, Governor Cobbs three-year-old daughter, Aurora died on the upper floor. People sometimes hear a little girl crying, Mama, Mama.  
Are these spirits still earthbound in this place and era of so much tragedy? You 
can judge for yourself. Tours are held Tuesday through Sunday. 
 
Mollys Georgia Fried Green Tomatoes  Ingredients: 
Several green tomatoes 
Flour (self rising) Cornmeal (yellow self rising is best) Salt and pepper to taste. Vegetable oil Buttermilk (regular milk can be substituted)  
Instructions: 
Mix equal parts of flour and cornmeal. Season liberally with the salt and pepper. Slice 
tomatoes in about ¼- to ½-inch slices. Dredge in the flour mixture then in the milk then back in the flour mix to coat well until all of the tomato slices are coated. Meanwhile heat about ½ inch of vegetable oil in large skillet (cast iron is best). When oil is very hot, toss in tomato slices. Tomatoes will brown quickly then turn to brown other side. Remove and drain on a paper towel and enjoy while hot.

thing you can be sure she cooked was a special Georgia delicacy, Fried Green Tomatoes. Molly probably used regular flour and meal and mixed in baking power but lets make life easy. Life is short and most ghosts dont cook in the hereafter.

SOPA DE ESTRELLITAS  (STAR PASTA) 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Outgoing and honey-throated, Joaquin Gonzalez is an international singing star 
about to embark on a brand-new movie career. Joaquin must win over not only Julie, but her disapproving Aunt Rose, too. Rose cooks traditional Mexican and Southwestern dishes, including the pasta side dish  estrellitas , or little starsa perfect 
accompaniment to many meat dishes. Little stars for big starsread the excerpt, then check Roses  Sopa de estrellitas . 
 
Excerpt from LOVES LASTING SONG : 
 
The cameras rolled on endlessly as people milled around. After a long time, the 
mayor escorted Sheryl and Joaquin back toward the airport terminal; the others in the entourage bustlingafter them, cameras still clicking and rolling. Randy was caught up in the crowd, too; Julie saw once, with surprise, that he was leaning close to hear something Joaquin was saying over his shoulder. There were limousines outside, long and white; within seconds, Joaquin and Sheryl were being hustled into one of them while others from the party crowded in after. Julie stood and watched until all the dignitaries were gone, then the reporters. 
  
  Is something wrong? Butch asked, already halfway across the parking lot. 
 
No. Julie forced a smile, waved at his battered pickup. Everythings fine. Go 
develop your pictures, Butch.  
He nodded and waved, hurrying off to his work, and for a long, long time, Julie 
just stood alone in the burning south Texas sun.  
Sopa de Estrellitas (Star Pasta) 
 
Ingredients: 
2 T olive or vegetable oil 
One 7-oz bag star shaped pasta 1 cube tomato/chicken bullion 4 cups water  
Instructions:  
 39Heat oil in a large, deep skillet. Pour in pasta, stirring gently but constantly until golden 
brown. Pour in water. Break a cube of bouillon into pieces and scatter in the skillet. Bring water to boil, stirring occasionally so that the bouillon is dissolved completely. Cook for 7 to 10 minutes on high heat, so that most of the liquid boils out. Stir occasionally to mix the bouillon evenly. Serve warm with meat dish, tortillas, and pinto beans, if desired. For variety, add finely cubed beef or pork with the bouillon and serve with vegetables for a complete meal, or add one diced jalapeño chili for Hot Star Pasta.

BEAT-THE-HEAT TOSTADAS 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Summers in Laredo, Texas are hoteven when youre not madly in love with an 
irritating, arrogant, drop-dead gorgeous entertainer from Argentina. So Julie Barnes, heroine of LOVES LASTING SONG , spends little of her time eating, and most of it 
fighting the attraction she feels for sexy Joaquin Gonzalez , in Laredo to star in the film version of her book, Shades . While Joaquin and Julie do battle over the food in some of 
Laredos finest restaurants, Julies boss, Randy appoints himself protector and confidant. 
 Fortunately for Julie, Randy has a better appetite than she does, and eventually 
arrives to gobble down the tostadas  Julies aunt Rose prepares as a light summer heat 
beater. Gather the ingredients, follow the simple steps belowthen sit down with a tostada  and enjoy reading the steamy romance LOVES LASTING SONG . Heres an 
excerpt to get you started!  
Excerpt from LOVES LASTING SONG : 
 
Child, why arent you eating? Aunt Rose gazed worriedly from the untouched 
tostada , heaped with lettuce, tomato, chicken and cheese, to Julies flushed face. Are 
you feeling okay?  
Julie picked up her glass of tea, frowned at it, and set it back down. She felt 
devastated, destroyed, but she wouldnt admit that to anyone. How easy it had been, losing controlcaring. The acknowledgment bit into her viciously: she had let herself care, and she shouldnt have. 
 
Beat-the-Heat Tostadas 
 
Ingredients: 
8 tostada  shells (crisp, whole corn tortillas) 
3 medium avocados, pitted, peeled, and pureed 3 cups cooked, boneless chicken, chilled (shredded and sprinkled with salt) One 14-oz can refried beans (optional) 2 medium diced tomatoes Shredded lettuce 2 cups grated cheese -- Monterrey Jack, cheddar, Colby, or any combination 1 pint sour cream (optional) 
 41 
Instructions: 
Dice tomatoes and shred lettuce; refrigerate until needed. Mash or puree avocado in a 
blender to make a smooth paste. Add salt and pepper to taste. (For smoother spreading consistency, mix in a dash of evaporated milk and stir well.) Spread each tostada  with 
refried beans, if desired, and then avocado. (For homemade refried beans, mash well-cooked pinto beans and fry in bacon grease, stirring frequently, for 2 or 3 minutes, until the beans form a thick paste.)  Spread chilled chicken on top of the avocado. Be generous!  Add diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and cheese according to taste. Sour cream may be spooned over the entire tostada  for extra taste and elegance.  Place left-over avocado, 
diced tomato, lettuce, and cheese on the table as extra toppings for hearty eaters. Tostadas are finger food, but provide forks for those who prefer to keep their fingers 
clean. Enjoy as a light meal perfect on a hot day!

MAKE AND RUN" ENCHILADA CASSEROLE 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Whitney Paige is worried sick about Morgans disappearance, although everyone 
who knew her sister swears that Morgan had probably just decided to go help someone in need. Morgans heart shadow, those who know her best explain, is gold, which means that she finds peace in her faith, and joy in helping other, which always keeps her busy. What better meal to cook and have on hand for emergencies than MorgansMake and Run Enchilada Casserole, perfect for a fast, hearty supper for the hungry, or for an easily reheated dinner after a hard days work? Make this casserole ahead of time, then sit down and enjoy another twist or turn in HEART SHADOWS . 
 
Excerpt from Heart Shadows:  
 
I hurried through the dark cool house to the front door and opened it. The porch 
was empty. No one was in sight. I stepped out onto the front porch. My sandaled foot touched something soft and furry. I looked down and stifled a scream. A dead cat lay on the porch. A note fastened to its orange fur with tape read, GO HOME. FORGET YOUR SISTER. YOU ARE NOT SAFE HERE.  
The ugly gray house lurched in front of my eyes. The floor seemed to roll up 
under my feet, pitching me at the puke-pink trim. I staggered inside, fighting waves of shock and nausea. I swayed into the hall, dropping leadenly into a chair next to the phone. Graces efficiency was apparent. A list of emergency numbers perched on the receiver. My trembling fingers managed to make the connection at the Sheriffs Department. Dwight Wilson promised to be right over.  
Crunching gravel announced Wilsons arrival. I struggled to my feet and trudged 
to the door. Then I gasped. The cat was gone. 
 
Make and Run Enchilada Casserole  Ingredients: 
2 lb of ground beef (cooked chicken or turkey may be substituted if desired) 
Two 12-oz cans tomato sauce (keep cans to measure water) One 1.25-oz pkg chili seasoning 24 corn tortillas Vegetable oil 1 lb cheddar cheese (or moremore cheese is always good!) Two 2.25-oz cans sliced black (ripe) olives (optional) 
 43 
Instructions: 
Brown the ground beef; omit this step for leftover chicken or turkey. Drain the fat and 
add the chili seasoning. Pour the tomato sauce into the pan, along with two cans of water. (Use the empty cans from the tomato sauce.) If using chicken or turkey, just place the meat in the pan, then add the tomato sauce and the water. Simmer; if using ground beef, be sure to cook until meat is completely done. While simmering the meat, pour vegetable oil into a small skillet to a depth of about an inch. Heat the oil, then dip each tortilla into the hot oil, browning lightly. For best results, use tongs to dip and remove tortillas.  Turn off meat-tomato mixture, and spoon a small amount into the bottom of a large, glass baking pan. Size can vary, but I usually use my 9 ½ by 13 inch pan. Cover the bottom with the sauce, then layer 12 of the tortillas on the bottomof the dish. Cover with the meat and chili sauce. Layer slices of cheddar cheese, then sprinkle with the chopped black olives, if desired. Make another layer, repeating the steps: tortillas, meat-chili sauce, cheese, and olives. When all the sauce is spooned over the top of layer of tortillas, lay on the cheddar cheese, and more olives if desired. Bake in a conventional oven at 350° F for 30 minutes or until the cheese is bubbling. Cool, cut into squares, and serve.

 44SPICY CHICKEN IN DANCING TOMATO SAUCE 
(aka Taco Chicken, for the uninspired cook) 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Whitney Paige was on a mission to save her younger sister Morgan from religious 
fanaticism when she left her green Georgia home for the barren reaches of the Great Basin Desert in Nevada She arrived to find spicy taco chicken simmering on the stoveand Morgan missing. The zesty chicken in sauce was almost welcoming enough to soothe Whitneys frayed temper from her first encounter with the arrogant, handsome Travis McLaughlin. Almost, but not quite.  
The mystery of Morgans disappearance deepens into the discovery of a years-old 
murder, a murderer, and Whitneys need to make a life-changing choice: cling to her green heart shadow of self reliance or flee to the safety of the cross? Her search for Morgan leads her into a deserted mine tunnel with rattlesnakes and a human skeletonand to the unwelcome realization that her feelings for Travis are pretty spicy themselves! Put this zesty fiesta celebration of chicken and tomato sauce on the stove to simmer, and then sit back and enjoy the Christian mystery/romance/suspense HEART SHADOWS . 
 
Excerpt from HEART SHADOWS : 
 
Room by room I investigated. They were all sparsely furnished and Morgan was 
not in any of them even though her car was in the drive. I pushed through swinging doors into the kitchen.  A tossed green salad sat in the center of the table. The table was set for two. Chicken simmered in a spicy taco sauce on the stove. She must be close! I called again. No answer.  
I peeked into pans. Peas stuck to the bottom of a stainless steel pot. They had 
started to burn. I cut the flame and checked the other pan. Spaghetti sat in a white, pasty, lump. I frowned and turned it off, too. It wasnt like Morgan to be so careless.  
Spicy Chicken In Dancing Tomato Sauce 
(aka Taco Chicken, for the uninspired cook) 
 
Ingredients: 
1 whole chicken, cut into pieces 
One 1.25-oz package of taco seasoning mix 4 T olive oil One 16-oz can of diced tomatoes 
 45 
Instructions: 
For this recipe, youll need one whole chicken, cut into pieces. It saves time to buy one at 
the store instead ofgrabbing it from the henhouse, butchering it, and plucking feathers. Plucking feathers is the worst part of being self-sufficient around chickens, and hot wet chicken smells bad. Back to the recipe before details about how chicken gets to the plate ruinsappetites.  Brown the chicken pieces in 4 T of olive oil. Pour off excess fat. Sprinkle one package of taco seasoning mix on the chicken pieces. Pour the diced tomatoes, with their juice, over the chicken. Cover the chicken and let it simmer until tender, usually 30 to 45 minutes.  Serving Suggestion:  While the chicken is simmering, cook 1 package spaghetti (choose 
size according to need) and veggies of choice to serve as side dishes. When the chicken is done, serve it on beds of hot spaghetti. This recipe feeds eight light eaters, or about six real hungry folks.

 48PEARLS EASY SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
In A COWBOYS WILL , Cody is a cowboy with a big appetitefor a lot of 
things. Blair is a city girl who has stepped into his world uninvited. How can two people with so little in common, and so much to fight each other about, find themselves falling in love.  
Excerpt from A Cowboys Will: 
 
Cody couldnt believe Blair had cooked supper. He picked up a golden-brown 
chicken leg and took a bite. It actually tasted good! After about the third bite he paused in mid-chew. There was something awful familiar about the flavor. He took another bite before it came to him. Pearls ! It was Pearls fried chicken from her restaurant. He 
looked up from his plate. Blair was munching away. You sure did surprise me, he said. I never guessed youd be a good cook. Im down right floored that you, from the north no less, know how to make good fried chicken.  
  She smiled, but had the good grace to look uncomfortable. Im glad you like it. 
 
Cody started to burst her bubble, let on that he knew she didnt cook this stuff. 
Then changed his mind. He didnt know what kept him from doing it. He took another bite of the delicious chicken. It made him think of Grady. Too bad Grady isnt here. He loved fried chicken. And he loved you and your mother. Cody hadnt meant to say that last part, it just popped out. 
 
  Blair pushed the salad around on her plate with her fork, then nodded. 
 
He swallowed a bite of potatoes and gravy. He realized he wanted to understand. 
Would it have been so hard for you to come see him from time to time? For your mother to come?  
 
PEARLS EASY SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN  
Ingredients:  
Chicken for frying (This can be one cut up fryer, or a 10-lb bag of leg quarters.) 
Flour Salt Black Pepper Oil 
 49 
Instructions: 
Fill a large frying pan about half full of oil. (I use a huge old cast iron one, since I usually 
have to cook lots of fried chicken at one time. Everyone I know loves fried chicken!) Wash your chicken pieces, salt and pepper each, then coat with flour. (It takes a little more salt than you would think, so dont just give it a tiny sprinkle. This isnt exactly healthy cooking any ways.) When your oil is goodand hot, carefully place each piece of chicken in the pan. The oil should be up at least half the height of the chicken. (This can also be deep fried if you prefer.) Once youve added as many pieces as fit without touching each other, lower your heat justa little, and fry chicken on each side until golden brown and well done inside. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the chicken pieces and the temperature of the oil.  When done, place chicken on pan lined with brown paper bags with a few paper towels on top of the bags. Sever warm or cold. (If you want gravy, pour out most of the oil from the pan, making sure not to pour out the drippings in the bottom from frying all of that chicken. Add in some flour and brown over high heat, stirring without taking a break. Once the flour is brownnot blackadd cold water, salt, pepper, chicken bouillon, and what other seasonings you like. Serve over rice or mashed potatoes.)

Excerpt from ARRANGED IN HEAVEN:  
 
  B-but youre dead. 
 
Im still watching you, baby. Youve made me proud. I like your young man, 
from what Ive seen of him. 
 
  Why cant I see you? Gayla thought she heard her mother choke back tears. 
 
Its a miracle that you can hear me. Im only supposed to be able to look at you, 
not talk with you. Im glad, though. I always wanted to tell you I was sorry for letting you down when you needed me most.  
It was Gaylas turn to cry. With the back of her hand she brushed tears from her 
cheeks. I let you down, Mom. I needed to say Im sorry, too. 
 
  Oh, Gayla. If only . . . 
 
Im okay, Mom. Really. Gayla heard a sizzling sound from the stove. Oh, no! 
Im burning the soup.  
Youll never get Danny to propose if you feed him out of a can, her mother told 
her, scolding in the gentle way Gayla remembered so well. You should make him a brisket, the way I taught you. With potatoes and carrots. And cheesecake for dessert.

 52NELS BAKED ROAST 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
From my second published inspirational romance novel, THE BRIDE WORE  
BOOTS , published by Heartsong Presents, Barbour Publishing, released November 2000. 
Roses deceased father has specified in his will she must come back from New York and spend one year under the tutorship of Bane, or she loses the ranch and it will go to Bane himself. This scene takes place immediately after Bane has suffered an injury while trying to save Roses horses and her burning barn. 
 
Excerpt from THE BRIDE WORE BOOTS:  
 
After Nels tasty lunch of baked roast smothered in its own gravy with creamy 
mashed potatoes, Bane pulled her to one side. 
 
  Get your jeans on, I want to show you something. 
 
With a quick look at his starched white western-cut shirt, trimmed with black 
embroidered roses and twining leaves, she asked with skepticism. Im to wear jeans and youre staying dressed like that? 
 He winked and gave her hand a squeeze. Got a bag in the truck. Ill change in 
your dads room while you get your duds on. Now hop to it! In no time, they were in Banes truck and heading down the lane.  
Where are we going? Rose watched the face of the driver as he barreled onto 
the gravel road in the opposite direction of town. The Sweet Water Ranch occupied much of the land in that direction, several other large ranches lay beyond. She couldnt think of a thing, or person, out that way hed want to visit. She slid over close and poked him in the ribs with her finger.  
Eeeoww! Dont do that, Im ticklish! The truck veered to the left, then to the 
right as he compensated and grasped the wheel with one hand while covering his ribs with the other. 
 
Oh? Glad to know that, if might come in handy! Her eyes sparkled as she 
continued to jab and poke at him.  
He brought the truck to a screeching halt and turned to his giddy tormentor. Hey, 
you! Two can play that game! 
 53Nels Baked Roast 
 
Ingredients:  
1 medium-sized chuck roast 
1 medium onion, chopped 2 cans cream of mushroom soup 2 regular-sized cans of tomato sauce 1 can of water  
Instructions: 
Rinse roast in warm water and place in bottom of clay baking dish or heavy baking pan. 
Pour water around edges of roast. Sprinkle chopped onion on top of roast. Spoon mushroom soup over onions. Pour tomato sauce over all. Add can of water. Cover tightly with lid. Or, use two layers of foil if you dont have a lid for your pan, but be sure to puncture it with several pricks of an ice pick or fork to allow some steam to escape. Bake in preheated 350 ° F oven for several hours, or until meat pulls apart easily. This recipe makes its own wonderful, thick gravy without any stirring during the baking process. Serve with fluffy, masked potatoes topped with a dab of butter. Yummy good!

Shes not so bad. Just an elderly maiden lady who has a knack with herbs and a 
sharp tongue. Actually, Bella is probably worse if someone crosses her. 
 He couldnt have done a better job if he had deliberately set out to terrify her. 
Who is Bella. 
 Bella is Arabella Standhope, widowed wife of Sir Malcolms younger brother. If 
you think of Polly as a hen with one chick, you would have to think of Bella as a 
brooding hen with two chicks, Natalie and Morgan. 
 I suppose they are my cousins? The word came easier. Deception probably got 
easier as you went along, she thought. 
 Loretta was still trying to process all the information about her new "relatives", 
when they turned into the drive of Standhope Manor. 
 It occurred to Lorie suddenly that she felt she had unwittingly stumbled onto a 
Hollywood set for a gothic movie. 
 Thecook, Mrs. Kelly served the meal, and one of the other maids, a rather shy 
looking girl named Janey, assisted her. The food was excellent. Beginning with a clear, beef broth and progressing to the main course of steamed Flounder with rice and peas, it wasall plain food yet well seasoned and filling. The wine was a mellow Chablis and did a lot for easing her growing tensions. In spite of her mixed feelings about Greg Morris, Lorie was glad to see he had remained for supper. His presence provided a buffer between her and the family.

VENISON STEW 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Visit for a day the Pikuni, a tribe of Blackfoot Indians living in 1870 Montana, 
and youll want to remain a week. Stay the week singing their songs, experiencing their kindness and joy, and youll want to dig-in for a month. Learn to kill a buffalo, tan hides, make a beaded dress, or taste antelope roasted over an open fire, and youll want to stay forever. But be warned, if you do, be willing to share the heartbreak of their lives and be willing to have your own irrevocably changed. So writes Meredith Campbell, author of RIGHTEOUS WARRIORS , about Gail Jenners  novel, ACROSS THE SWEET 
GRASS HILLS (ISBN 88739-302-0 ).  ACROSS THE SWEET GRASS HILLS  tells of a 
man, a woman, and a people trapped by events that threaten their survival. A love story, it is also the tale of the Marias Massacre.  
Excerpt from ACROSS THE SWEET GRASS HILLS:  
 
Please, can you help us? I mean, are you headed to a fort? 
 
The soldier mumbled an unintelligible reply. In a manner of speakin, I am, he 
added quickly, cocking his head. But I sure could eat and drink somethin. I feel like a post hole as aint been filled up.  
He grinned and Liza felt the rush of blood to her face. 
 
Lost my pack horse, he added. Of course, II have a small stew, antelope is 
all.  
She refrained from telling him about Red Eagle, although she didnt know why. 
 
Snake stew would taste good right now, interrupted the soldier. 
 
Liza made a wry face. Please, what about my father? She stepped over to the 
fire and lifted the kettle of meat prepared earlier for Red Eagle.  
Who dug the bullet out? You? 
 
Well, it had to come out... 
 
Aint yuh as gritty as aigs rolled in sand!

EASY AND ELEGANT COUNTRY CHICKEN KIEV 
 
Excerpt from THE COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO THROWING A GREAT 
PARTY  (ISBN: 002863974X ): 
 
Its bound to happen sometime. You have to make dinner for your boss, new love, 
a client or someone else you need to impress. Unfortunately your cooking skills are lacking and your entire collection of dinnerware consists of paper plates, plastic forks and matching Star Trek glasses from McDonalds.     
Relax, its not a hopeless cause. In fact, preparing a formal dinner can be easy and 
fun.     
Borrow what you can, but if thats not possible, almost every town has a rental 
business. There you can lease everything you need to set up a perfect dinner party in almost any space.     If you dont have dining room furniture, start by renting a table and chairs. If the chairs are unattractive, rent chair covers. Add a to-the-floor tablecloth for instant elegance and to cover the often unattractive table legs. Opt for coordinating napkins and order an extra six just in case.     
Get candleholders in varying heights to add drama to your table. Choose a  
simple pattern for your dinner, salad, soup, dessert and bread and butter plates along with coffee cups and saucers. Select salt and pepper shakers, glasses, flatware, and serving pieces to round out your order. Youll learn all about setting the table in THE 
COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO THROWING A GREAT PARTY . 
   
Except for the chicken, dinner is a matter of heat and serve. Buy packaged,  
mixed salad greens and a quality Italian salad dressing for your first course. Your frozen food section will have a variety of prepared rice and vegetable side dishes which would partner perfectly with the following recipe. Head to your bakery for dessert and dinner rolls and your meal is complete. The following recipe is delicious, company-perfect and foolproof.

Excerpt from PERILOUS SUMMER:  
 
  Who are you? Why are you following me?

 VEGETARIAN PIZZA 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Cassandra Ashe, an aspiring social worker, befriends Nikki, a motherless native 
teen. Delivering Nikki for her court-ordered counseling, Cass is shocked to discover John Deadmarsh is the psychologist. John and Cass have a past. She vanished from his bed, and his life, 17 years ago. How long, he wonders, before she abandons the vulnerable Nikki?  
Excerpt from HAUNTED BY DREAMS:  
 
Omigod, look at you, Nikki!  The young Native girl pushed herself away from the railing, brushing her hair 
behind one ear. From a center part, two bands of newly-dyed orange hair fell to her shoulders, framing her face as dramatically as any teen could wish. 
 So, whaddya think?  The girls words were casual, but Cass saw the uncertainty in her eyes. Come in 
and let me look at you. She drew Nikki inside. Okay, now twirl around for me. 
 Nikki rolled her eyes but obliged, although her lazy turning could hardly be 
described as a twirl. 
 I like it.  Nikki bent to scoop up Casss wiry Siamese, burying her flushed face in the cats 
fur. 
 Cass looked at her watch. Say, do you think we have time for a snack before we 
go? 
 Nikki grinned. That depends. Whatcha got?  Cassandra always happened to have something at the ready, and Nikki always 
came early enough to avail herself of it. Not that the kid needed handouts. But Cass suspected she subsisted on Diet Coke and french fries, like most teens. 
 Vegetarian pizza.  
 63Eeew! Whats on it? 
 Lets just say youve probably never eaten broccoli this way.  Broccoli!  I did
 hold the zucchini. 
 Okay, okay. Ill try it, Nikki grumbled, depositing the cat on the floor again.  Cass smiled.

  QUINCE AND SPARROW PIE 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
In ALL FOR A GOOD CAUSE, Janet, the heroine, and her sister have been 
recruited into cooking at the medieval charity fair. She should be preparing a roast, but, while sneaking the beer marinade, she watches the hero Devin battle for her hand in marriage. Janet puts down her tumbler of beer.  
Excerpt from ALL FOR A GOOD CAUSE:  
 
Just checking it. Besides, I need something to get me through the weekend. Im 
going to be married tomorrow and my betrothed is being beaten to a pulp by the sheriff.  
Maggie-Ann peered out at the practice field. Good God, is he ever. If I didnt 
know better, Id say Silas was enjoying it. Maybe youre the prize.  
If I am, Im going home. 
 
Dont want to marry Silas? Maggie-Ann asked. 
 
The thought turns my stomach. 
 
Maybe its all the beer youre swilling. Get the meat into it, before its all gone, 
will you? Youre making supper, remember?  
Janet dumped the huge seasoned roast into the clay pot shed swiped with grease. 
Almost crying, she dumped the beer into it. What next?  
Check the list, Maggie-Ann said. 
 
Janet walked over to the table and sat down. The lady whod organized all the 
meals had been precise with her instructions.  
Take out the pie pastry and fill it with the quince and sparrow mixture, she 
read. Good grief, Maggie-Ann, who killed the sparrows for this?  
Maggie-Ann laughed, slopping the custard over the rim of the bowl. Theyre just 
Cornish hens. Youll have to eat some of that tonight. Theyre an aphrodisiac. 
 66 
Janet automatically glanced up at Devin, who was now shaking Silass hand. He 
was grinning, but abruptly, he twisted about. Their gazes locked and his grin widened, shooting like a bullet at her. Immediately, he began to rub his hip and frown.  
Janet snorted. What a terrible actor.  
 
Quince and Sparrow Pie  
 
Ingredients: 
1 package puff pastry, approx. 10 oz, thawed and rolled out to ¼-inch thick 
1 medium onion, chopped 2 T olive oil 2 cups chopped cooked chicken or Cornish hen breast ½ tsp each dried oregano, basil, parsley Salt and pepper to taste 1 cup chopped pears 2 tsp sugar (omit if using canned or fully ripe pears or apples)  
Instructions: 
Preheat oven to 400° F. Line an 8-inch pie plate with half of the pastry. Sauté the onion 
in the oil until softened. Add chicken, herbs, salt and pepper to taste. Add fruit (and sugar if necessary) and sauté gently for 2 minutes. Fill pie shell and cover with remaining pastry, sealing the edges tightly. Bake until top pastry is golden brown. Cool before cutting.  (A medieval aphrodisiac, Quinces nowadays are only popular as a jelly or preserve. They have a taste between a pear and apple. If you cant find any quinces, try an equal amount of slightly unripe pears or apples. If you use ripe or canned fruit, omit the sugar. This recipe uses pears. Obviously, sparrows arent used anymore in cooking. Cornishhens are the poultry of choice, but chicken is used here to create a quick, savory pie.)

BAKED JAMBALAYA 
 
Excerpt from TRUE NATURE: 
 
The waitress returned with the food, explaining that the band was auditioning that 
night for a more permanent position, and then refilled their drinks leaving them to their meals. 
 Kailen tasted everything on her own plate, and then at Marcs urging, tasted his as 
well. They both finally settled in on eating each others meals. She was delighted by all the different flavors and closed her eyes and savored each item, before moving on to the next. 
 Marc was enjoying dinner through her experience, watching her closely, noticing 
the way she took the time to savor the moment before moving on to the next. Their conversation founded around the food they were eating, and what general information Marc could give about the area and its history. 
 The band began playing some soft melodies, and the owner of the restaurant sat at 
a front table, smoking a large cigar, occasionally speaking to the man seated beside him. 
 About the time that they had finished their meal, the band began to play a 
different style of music; a toe tapping, fast paced sound and Kailen could not help but move along with the beat. 
 The lead singer started singing along with a heavily accented language and Marc 
quickly pointed out to Kailen that it was the regional dialect for the people in the area. 
 A few people started to leave their tables and dance on the small wooden floor set 
off to the far side of the stage for that purpose. Kailens eyes were shining brightly, and a blush rose in her cheeks as an elderly man approached her and asked her if she would mind to dance with him. Marc nodded his approval with a wide grin, and a sly look in his eye, knowing Kailen probably did not know how to two-step very well, if at all.

 69FAVORING CURRY 
 
Excerpt from The Anti-Recipe Book:  
 
I still remember the time I invited Margaret back to my apartment after a very 
pleasant country walk having promised her a cosy meal and whatever else might follow. While she went for a bath I started to prepare. Or perhaps I prepared to start. Either way the fridge was empty and, as Winnie the Pooh might have said, the more I opened the door the more there was nothing there. I found a couple of eggs, and, in a cupboard, an onion and some potatoes and then bowed my head in anguish as I contemplated the success or failure of the next few hours of my life.   
Margaret was a theatrical woman. Id met her at a social club that tried to put on 
an occasional amateur production.As far as she was concerned, she was the production. Used to meet people by holding out both hands. And now she was due to slink out of the bathroom and make her grand entrance. She would be nicely warmed for a romantic evening of conversation and togetherness and I was considering the options of making egg and fries or having to admit I had forgotten to buy any food. What was worse, I wondered, an admission, by implication, that I did not care sufficiently to plan our day out properly or the presentationof a wholly inadequate and anticlimactic meal of one egg each with some greasy potatoes and a slice of bread.   
In a second cupboard I found some rice and pasta and various cans of soups, 
beans and tomatoes. I also found a few herbs and, the final clue as to the way to get out of this mess, some Tandoori curry powder. Margaret was not a great cook and was very amenable to my experimentation, even viewing me at times with quizzical respect. Thus I decided to take a chance on a vegetable curry that was virtually devoid of real vegetables.  
Favoring Curry 
  
Ingredients: 
3 T oil 
1 clove of garlic Assorted spices (e.g., crushed coriander, cardamom, cumin seeds) 1 inch of root ginger, peeled 2 tsp curry powder 1 small onion ½ tin of tomatoes 1 green pepper ½ small cauliflower Salt and pepper 8 mushrooms 1 cup rice Touch of turmeric 
 
 70Instructions:  
(Curries are so versatile that its difficult to know what to exclude. This is a vegetarian 
example.) 
 
Lightly fry the chopped or crushed garlic, chopped onion and finely chopped ginger in 
the oil until softened. Add the chopped pepper, cauliflower, tomatoes, spices, salt, pepper and curry powder. In a separate saucepan, heat a pint of water with salt, pour in the rice and cook in accordance with the instructions. Add a touch of turmeric to the rice for an interesting color. Add the chopped mushrooms to the vegetables and keep heating. When the rice is just soft, drain and serve with the curry.  
A simple meat curry can be based on minced beef. This should be gently fried with onions and garlic until 
browned before adding the vegetables. Another version that goes down well is prawns,which can take a lot of ginger for extra sophistication. The prawns should be added late, say 5 minutes before you finish 
cooking. Chicken is another favorite but can be messy unless you buy something like ready prepared 
breast. Beef, lamb and pork can all be bought ready diced but is still much more of a hassle. If the meat is of cheap quality, it can take a lot of cooking. Strictly, these meats should be sitting in the curry flavors for a long time before the process begins in earnest and there is a whole range of powders and pastes that can be used for the purpose. 
 
To get a smoother, more liquid finish, try half a tin of mushroom soup mixed with the spices before adding it to the curry. You may need to use real tomatoes rather than tinned to avoid the whole thing drowning. Other soups work subject to your experience and courage but too much and you might find the mixture wandering all over the table. One outrageous but simple example might be Scotch Broth and Potato Curry.  Any vegetable will work in a curry. Try carrots, beans, courgettes and potatoes. Some of the hard vegetables, like carrots and potatoes, may need to be chopped and boiled first to make sure they soften up in good time. If you need greater volume, boil some lentils for a few minutes and add these. Try any spice and curry powder or paste that you find. Given the right measures, I havent found one I dislike yet.

TUNA TEMPTATION  
 
Setting the Scene:  
In JUDGEMENT BY FIRE , by Gleana Connell, a/k/a Glenys OConnell , 
Lauren Stephens is a woman who's learned to stand up for her rights  and that includes leading a protest movement to prevent the closure of the artists' colony where she lives in rural Ontario, Canada. There's a major problem, however  she's falling in love with the head honcho of the company who wants to turn the artists' colony at Haverford Castle into a health spa for the very wealthy. When Lauren becomes the target of a stalker and her studio is savagely vandalized, she turns to companyCEO Jon Rush for protection  and he's happy to volunteer. Lauren's grateful to her friends and neighbors who have cleaned up her damaged home and stocked her refrigerator with her favourite tuna'n'cheese casserole, because she and Jon have better things to do than cook..  
Excerpt from JUDGEMENT BY FIRE : 
 
To Lauren, from your friends. Remember  home is where the heart is.  Lauren 
read the words aloud, and tears started up afresh. You know, none of this stuff is mine, but I recognize most of it  seems like everyone in Haverford Castle  and a lot of people in West River, too, have contributed to rebuilding my home.  
You have a lot of friends here, Lauren, people who love you, Jon said softly 
from where he still leaned against the doorpost. A few guys from a Rush Co. cleaning crew came out to help clear everything up, and they told me that people were in and out all morning with odds and ends of stuff, sending you their best wishes, too. The fridge, I believe, is fully stocked with about a years supply of coffee beans and home-made macaroni and tuna cheese casserole.  
Seems my tastes are well known, Lauren laughed. But her gaze turned serious 
as she met Jons look and realized that he still stood at the doorway. Come in Jon, please  stay with me?  
The quiet question lit dark fires of desire in his eyes and, shutting the door behind 
him, he crossed the room in moments to take her in his arms and cover her face with 
gentle kisses. But he drew back then, fixing her eyes with a gaze which poured out his feelings more surely than a thousand words  and which drank in the love that was displayed on her face.  
I think,  he said quietly, That you should heat up some of that macaroni, and 
make us some coffee. Ill light a fire in that stove to air the house  and I think Ill go out and let that poor kid in the police car know Im staying and he can maybe go home and get some sleep himself. 
 72Good lord, for a moment I thought you were going to suggest he join us for 
supper, Lauren muttered, but Jon heard and grinned at her.  
Oh, no, my love  this is strictly an evening for two. And leaving that promise 
sizzling on the air between them, he went out into the night. 
Tuna Temptation  a cheese'n'tuna pasta dish for two 
 
Ingredients: 
About 5 ounces of pasta quills or elbow macaroni 
1 tin of tuna chunks in brine, well drained 1 oz (or 2 T) butter 1 oz (or 2 T) plain flour 300 ml (or 1-¼ cups) whole milk ½ tsp American mustard 115 g (or 4 oz) grated cheese for sauce 50 g  (or 2 oz) grated cheese for topping Thinly sliced tomato  
Instructions: 
Cook pasta according to packet directions. 
Place the butter in a medium sized microwave bowl and microwave on high (750 watt oven) for 30 seconds until melted. Stir in the flourand add the milk, whisking gently. Microwave again on high for 3 to 4 minutes, whisking gently several times during the cooking process. Let stand in the warm microwave for another minute, then whisk in the mustard and fold in the 4 oz of grated cheese.  Drain the pasta well and place in a medium sized ovenproof dish. Add the drained tuna, mixing it in with the pasta. Pour the cheese sauce over and mix with a spoon. Lay the thinly sliced tomatoes over the top, and sprinkle on the remaining grated cheese.Bake in a medium oven for about 30 minutes or until the cheese topping is bubbly and beginning to brown. Do not overcook or the pasta will become hard on top.  This one-dish mean can be served with salad and garlic bread. Covered, it keeps well in the refrigerator for 24 hours, and can be quickly heated up the day after preparation for a meal when you've got better things to do than cook!

WASILLAS FRUIT CUP 
 
Setting the Scene:  
When Victorias mother suddenly falls in love with a man she meets on a cruise 
ship and decides to marry him and move to Alaska, Victorias dreams of opening a gift shop in Kansas City with her mother as full partner collapse. Now she and her new step-brother-to-be, Buck Silverbow, must find a way to stop them. However, when Buck realizes how much in love their parents are, he changes his mind about interfering, which infuriates Victoria. This scene takes place in the dining room of the hotel Buck and his father own. 
 
Excerpt from Northern Exposure: 
 
Ron signaled to Wasilla and she hurried to their table. Now, I suggest we all tell 
Wasilla what wed like for lunch.  
Buck shot a quick glance across the table to Victoria with a shrug of his shoulders 
and although she was glad the confrontation had stopped, she hoped his shrug didnt imply he was giving up. They had to change their parents minds.   
Once a pleasant lunch of salmon salad, croissants and a fresh fruit cup was 
enjoyed, Ron suggested Victoria and her mother spend sometime together while the men folk took care of their chores.

 RED HOT JELLO 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Dan Castleberry, an internationally famous ice skater, sits alone in his wealthy 
parents home. Its Thanksgiving morning, and the house is empty. Mr. and Mrs. Castleberry, in their usual custom, are having Thanksgiving dinner at the Country Club. Dan is looking forward to an old-fashioned, home-cooked meal at Carlees house, with her two children. She invites him to come over earlier than planned, eager to spend as much time with him as possible. 
  
Excerpt of Ice Castle: 
 
 By ten oclock, the scent of roasting turkey and sage dressing filled the Bennett 
house. The salads were chilled, the corn casserole was ready to pop into the oven, the homemade Parkerhouse rolls were rising and dinner was well under control. Bobby and Becca were watching the Odyssey videotape, and Carlee was putting the finishing 
touches on the cheesecake. The sound of the Gaither Vocal Band filled the kitchen and made her spirits soar as she harmonized along with them. Dan was due at eleven and life was good. On a sudden whim, she crossed the room and dialed his number. He answered almost immediately. Ah ha! Youre sitting on the phone. Who were you expecting to call? Ed McMahon or Dick Clark?    
Naw, what would I do with ten million smackeroos? Whats up? You got that 
rubber turkey cooking in the oven?   
She felt a little foolish calling him, her mother had always cautioned her against 
girls calling boys for no good reason. Funny she should think of that now. Dan was hardly a boy. And she was way beyond the girl stage. Friends should be able to call friends, shouldnt they? I was thinking about you, wondering if you were busy? I thought maybe youd like to come over a little early.   
Sure, if you need help. His voice sounded eager. 
RED HOT JELLO 
 
Ingredients: 
¾ cup red hots (or more) 
Three 3-oz packages of lemon Jello 3 cups boiling water 2-¾ cups cold water 
 761 can applesauce (NOT chopped applesauce) 
*Optional: 4 oz (1/2 small package) cream cheese with enough milk blended to make nice consistency for topping  
Instructions: 
Dissolve red hots in boiling water, stirring constantly until dissolved. Add dry Jello to 
mixture and stir until Jello is dissolved. Add cold water. Stir in applesauce. Chill until firmly set, stirring several times to keep applesauce from sinking to bottom  *A dollop of the cream cheese mixture on top of each serving makes a nice touch and adds flavor.

 77HARVEST PUMPKIN PIE CHEESECAKE 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
My book fits in the self-help category. You may wonder what self-help has to do 
with pumpkin cheesecake. Well, just like my Harvest Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake (YUM!), the book is spicy, loaded with zest and spunk. And believe it or not, I mention cheesecake three times in the book. No, its not one of the 9 habits of maximum happiness. But it comes pretty close! Here is an excerpt from Chapter 8  Great Expectations. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I know youll enjoy the cheesecake.  
Excerpt from CLIMB YOUR STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN: THE 9 HABITS OF 
MAXIMUM HAPPINESS  (ISBN 0-595-17826-X): 
 
Poet Emily Dickinson tells the same story in a different way: Eden is that old-
fashioned house we dwell in every day without suspecting our abode until we drive away. All the stones we need to build our Stairway to Heaven are within reach. We just have to recognize them. 
 And we have to move them. God doesnt make orange juice, God makes 
oranges, Jesse Jackson says. God doesnt make happiness either. He gives wonderful things to be happy about. We dont find ever-lasting love, despite what the songs saywe make love everlasting when we want the love we have. 
 Cherry blossoms swirling in the breeze across the streets of Washington, D.C. 
The haunting call of the loon on the early morning lake. The taste of pumpkin cheesecake. The aroma of lilacs floating in the spring air. (The aroma floats, not the lilacs.) The laughter of children. The warmth of a campfire on a chilly Algonquin* autumn evening. When we really look at what wehave, we see a beautiful world we should never take for granted. The Rolling Stones were wrong; we can get satisfaction. * A favorite camp ground of ours.  
HARVEST PUMPKIN PIE CHEESECAKE 
 CRUST: 
1 cup of ginger snap crumbs 
1 T of canola or olive oil  
FILLING: 
1-½ cups pureed pumpkin (not pre-mixed pumpkin pie filling) 
3 bricks cream cheese (softened) 3 large eggs 2 T cream (table cream, whipping cream  the heavier, the better) 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 cup packed brown sugar 1 T cinnamon 
 781 T ground ginger 
½ tsp salt 1 tsp ground nutmeg ½ tsp allspice  
TOPPING: 
Whipped cream 
½ cup chopped pecans 
 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Mix the ginger snap crumbs and oil very well. Pour the crumbly mixture into a 
greased 9-inch springform pan. Press down and an inch up along the sides so it forms a crust. Place the pan in the fridge to chill while preparing the filling. 
2. This is the messy (fun) part. Cream the cheese, then mix in the cream, sugar, eggs, 
and pumpkin until the mixture is very smooth. 
3. This is the best time to pre-heat the oven to 350
o F. 
4. Add in the salt and seasonings. If you like flavor, as my wife Chantal and I do, feel 
free to upsize the seasonings by 25 to 50 percent. Blend the seasonings into the filling mixture. 
5. Pour the filling into the crust, pop it into the oven and bake until the top is golden 
brown and probably cracked (at least 50 minutes). 
6. Cool the cake completely on a wire rack, then place in the fridge to chill (at least 6 
hours). 
7. Just before serving, cover the top with whipped cream and sprinkle with chopped 
pecans 
 Yum! That tastes great. Now you can sit back and enjoy a good book, like CLIMB 
YOUR STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN: THE 9 HABITS OF MAXIMUM HAPPINESS . 
But what about the author-chef? Who is he anyway? Well, heres a short excerpt from my 
official biography:

 79SWEET & SOUR APPLE STRUSSEL CHEESECAKE 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Food is one of the few essentials we need. Everything else is a bonus to be 
appreciated. Thats one of the important messages of CLIMB YOUR STAIRWAY TO 
HEAVEN . But in the case of cheesecake, food can also be a bonus to appreciate. Here is 
an excerpt from Chapter 8  Great Expectations, which demonstrates how important it is to appreciate cheesecake  among other things. By the way, in this excerpt you will read about my forty-third slice of cheesecake. In fact, there are just over 43 slices of apple  in 
this cake, but why quibble over details when something tastes this good? 
 
Excerpt from Climb your Stairway to Heaven: the 9 habits of maximum happiness  
(ISBN 0-595-17826-X): 
 
There is a difference between desire and expectation. We can desire to be healthy, 
for instance, or we can expect to be healthy. If we desire to be healthy, each day we wake up pleased to have what we desire. If we expect to be healthy, its just not that exciting. Worse, if we fall sick, we feel cheated out of an entitlement. 
 Hunger makes us appreciate food, which I believe, in part, explains the Christian 
tradition of fasting for Lent and the Muslim tradition of fasting for Ramadan. Thirst teaches us to appreciate water. Fatigue helps us appreciate sleep.  
On the other hand, we seldom appreciate what we have in abundance. Even I, 
who love cheesecake, stop appreciating it after the forty-third slice. But when its been months since Ive had a slice, theres little I appreciate more. Our own expectations determine our appreciation, and we control our expectations. 
 OK, time to appreciate another cheesecake. 
 
SWEET & SOUR APPLE STRUSSEL CHEESECAKE  Ingredients: CRUST: 
1 cup all-purpose flour 
½ cup canola or olive oil 1/3 cup granulated sugar  
FILLING: 
5 apples (I like McIntosh apples for this.) 
3 T lemon juice 2 T granulated sugar 1 T canola or olive oil 1-½ T cinnamon 1 brick cream cheese (softened) 2 large eggs 
 801 cup sour cream (Light sour cream is great.) 
½ cup packed brown sugar 
 
TOPPING: 
½ cup all-purpose flour 
¼ cup canola or olive oil ¼ cup packed brown sugar ½ tsp cinnamon  
INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Mix the flour, oil and sugar very well. Pour the crumbly mixture into a greased 9-inch 
springform pan. Press down and an inch up along the sides so it forms a crust. Place the pan in the fridge to chill while preparing the filling. 
2. Peel, core and slice the apples. Each apple should make 8 or 12 slices (cut in two, cut 
each half in two, cut each quarter in two or three). Place in lemon juice to avoid apple rust, and pour in the sugar and cinnamon. 
3. Heat the oil in the pan, and pour the apple mixture into the pan, stirring at medium 
heat for about 3 minutes (just enough to make them a little tender). 
4. Cream the cheese, then mix in the sour cream, brown sugar, and eggs until the 
mixture is very smooth. 
5. This is the best time to pre-heat the oven to 350
o F. 
6. Pour the apple mixture into the crust, spreading evenly. 7. Pour the cheese filling over the apples. 8. Mix the topping ingredients until good and crumbly and sprinkle the mixture over the 
top of the cake. 
9. Pop it into the oven and bake for 45 minutes. 10. Cool the cake completely on a wire rack, then place in the fridge to chill (at least 6 
hours). 
Mmmm-mm. Apples and cheese taste good together any time of year, and this cheesecake just brings out the best of both. At this point, the author of Climb your 
Stairway to Heaven: the 9 habits of maximum happiness  (thats me.) is supposed to tell 
you something about himself (thats also me.). So heres another excerpt from my official biography: 
 
Authors Bio:  
David is a lover of nature. His favorite activities take place far from the towers of 
the city: hiking, camping, canoeing, wildlife spotting. He says, Ive lunched with moose, snacked with ducks, shared a camp site with a black bear, and served as a snack for countless mosquitoes.

 81BERRY BLUE LAYER CHEESECAKE 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
By now, most readers will have surmised that I love cheesecake. Ive included 
several mentions in my book, including one in an exercise. Did I mention the exercises, the pop quizzes, the quotations, the humour and wit, the puns, the energy and the cave-style cartoons? Yes, its a self-help book. No, it doesnt look like one or read like one. This book is plain and simple fun  as well as helping every one of us increase our happiness. Heres an excerpt from Chapter 9  Happy Thanksgiving. 
 
Excerpt from Climb your Stairway to Heaven: the 9 habits of maximum happiness  
(ISBN 0-595-17826-X): 
Exercise:  
Can you determine the value of all you have? Lets make a list. Start with your 
left eye. Would you sell it for$10? $20? $100? $1,000? $1,000,000? Not at all? Now considering that your left eyeball has been sold, for how much would you sell your right eye? Keep doing this for every part of your body. I suspect youll discover your true value is hundreds of times infinity. You are priceless.  
Before reading any further, how about going through the same exercise with all 
the other things you have? Shelter, clothing, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, freedom of thought, fresh air, water, food, a library card, talent (can you dance, sing, sew, play pool, bowl, read, garden, tell jokes, bake a rich and great-tasting cheesecake, swim?)everything you have. This will help you later in the chapter. You dont have to list every single pen or cracker or toothpick or shoe you own, but take about 15 minutes to jot down what comes to mind: freedoms, opportunities, friends, skills, knowledge, possessionsanything you have.  
Chantal, my wife, asked me to make her a scrumptious blueberry cheesecake. 
You, too, can bake this rich and great-tasting cheesecake.

 83OVER THE RAINBOW CAFÉS FAMOUS FRUIT SALAD 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Dorothy Gale Robinson, an aspiring actress, is the daughter of hippie parents with 
a passion for old movies. When her father is killed suddenly while sipping a non-fat decaf mocha latte at a local coffee shop, Dorothys life is turned upside down. In this scene, Dorothys mother decides to sell the family home and open a New Age Café.  
Excerpt from Hey Dorothy Youre Not in Kansas Anymore : 
 
I yelled for my mom but there was no response. Then the phone started ringing. I 
picked it up: Hello, I said. 
 
 Dorothy - this is your mother.  
 Where are you, Mom? 
  Im staying at your brothers for a few days. Theyre still painting my apartment.   Your what? 
 
 My apartment, Sweetie.    Why do you have an apartment?   Because Im selling the house. 
 
 Why are you selling your house?   Thats the only way I can afford to pay for the café.   What café? 
 
 The one Im buying 
 
        Because necessity is the mother of invention - at least, I think its the mother and not the father - my mother made the decision to sell the house and all her stuff and use any profits to buy an old café with a small apartment above it in Ybor City. Her plan was to fix it up and create a unique theme. She decided to make her café a metaphysical bistro serving a light vegetarian menu - exotic coffees, herbal teas and fresh-squeezed juices - and providing card readings, psychics, crystals and other mystical, supernatural, spiritual stuff. And the establishment was to be called Over the Rainbow Metaphysical Café. (No surprise there!) At first, I thought the idea was total crap, but the more I thought about it, the more I liked it. Especially when I realized my moms underlying, subconscious, metaphoric reason for wanting to open Over the Rainbow Café: to battle the evil Buckstars in their plot to take over the world. There had to be a good guy out there somewhere

NO BANANA BANANA PUDDING 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
In TO LOVE THROUGH TIME , Jessica, a simple school teacher, finds herself 
 85fascinated by her rich and sexy neighbor, Clay. Little does she know how fascinated he is 
by her, or how much of a past they share. 
 
Excerpt from To Love Through Time:  
 
Jessica rang the doorbell and waited nervously until Clay appeared. Right on 
time, he said with a smile. That smile caused her pulse to accelerate. Dont look so worried. Im a good cook.  
Jessica followed him to the kitchen where he took the plastic dish she had 
brought. Its no banana banana pudding...the only recipe Ive mastered. She didnt add how many disasters it had taken for her to come up with pudding that any human would care to consume. 
 
 I bet its delicious. He showed her to the elegant dining room and helped her be seated at the table. 
 
 The food he had prepared waited in lovely china bowls. Once they began to eat, Jessica tired not to pick over her food, no matter how nervous she felt. Why did the tho ught of sharing a meal 
seem like something so intimate all of a sudden? His hamburger steaks with onion gravy and rice were delicious. So were the green beans and rolls he served on the side. 
 
 Jessica had half expected some fancy dish she wouldnt be able to pronounce, much less stand the taste of. Her family was simple, middle-class people. She felt out of place in Clays exorbitant home, but tried her best not to let it show. They ate slowly, making small talk. Mostly she talked and Clay listened. He carried on so about how great her pudding was, that she felt herself blush with pride. He even ate a second helping as if to prove it. 
 
No Banana Banana Pudding 
 Ingredients: 
4 boxes Instant Banana Cream Pudding Mix 
1 box vanilla wafer cookies 1 small container of whipped cream topping 1 small container of sour cream Milk  
Instructions: 
Spread vanilla wafer cookies in a layer on the bottom of a square cake pan, or dessert 
pan. In a large bowl make the instant pudding following the direction onthe box. (You can stir in a few drops of Banana or almond extract if you like.) When the pudding is thick enough, add the whipped topping and stir. Next add the sour cream and stir. Once mixed well, pour over the cookies.  Place in refrigerator (what I still call the ice box) to chill at least 3 hours, though over night is best. This recipe is easy to double to carry with you to Sunday dinner on the ground. You can top it with more whipped topping if you like, and sprinkle with a small amount of chopped pecans. The cookies and pudding mix can also be done in layers. Heck, you can even add bananas if you just gotta have em.

Authors Bio:  
Charlotte Dillon  was born in Louisiana. As a child she feared bedtime, when the 
lights were turned out and her room settled into darkness. There was a way not to notice the slow movement that she could swear was near her closet, or the soft breaths that she could almost hear under her bedmake up a story. Each night, while she waited for sleep to come, she invented characters, designed worlds, and slipped away from the darkness and her childish fears. 
 
   As an adult, Charlotte  still makes up bedtime tales, but now she has a perfect 
place to share those adventures, in her books. She spends her days as a freelance writer,and evenings and weekends working on her tales of heroes, horses, and the kind of romance that dreams are made of.

ACROSS THE SWEET GRASS HILLS  is brimming with history, packed with  
emotion, and told with imagination strong enough to bind it into a  fast-paced, memorable tale.

recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical romance or adventure. 
~ Mary Lou Rich, COURTING KATE  
 87Through thorough-going research, Ms. Jenner brings history alive. She recreates 
a band of Pikuni (Blackfoot) Indians and gives us a taste of their lives. Im not sure if Red Eagles uncle, Crying Wind, actually lived, but Id like to think so. And Id like to think Red Eagle and Liza go on to a long happily-ever-after. 
~Jane Bowers, editor, from ROMANCE REVIEWS TODAY 
 
Excerpt from ACROSS THE SWEET GRASS HILLS: 
 
Crying Wind stood at the door of his lodge shouting his invitations.  One byone 
the men came. Each sat around the host according to his standing in the tribe; first, Red Quiver, the sun priest, then warriors of high rank.  After all were seated, Crying Winds wives placed dishes of food before them while he cut up tobacco. The guests ate slowly. There was boiled meat, stewed berries and berry soup.  Finally, Crying Wind spoke. Others, too, each took his turn sharing past victories in battle or thrilling escapes wile riding for buffalo. After awhile the talk turned to visions, questions, and dreams; Red Quiver shared the dream hed had during the night.  We were moving along the edge of Big River. As the sun set, a raven, black against the sky, flew toward us. He circled three times, then flew away. He returned and circled three more times. We watched him closely.  We waited and watched until the night was black but the raven did not return.

 BUCKSTARS SINFUL MOCHA CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS 
 
Setting the Scene:  
 
Dorothy Gale Robinson, an aspiring actress, is the daughter of hippie parents with 
a passion for old movies. When her father is killed suddenly while sipping a non-fat decaf mocha latte at a local coffee shop, Dorothys life is turned upside down. In this scene, Dorothy and her twin brother, Jude, discuss their fathers death. 
 
Excerpt from Hey Dorothy Youre Not in Kansas Anymore  (ISBN 1-931391-43-2): 
 
A few hours later, I woke up in my old bedroom. It had been about eight years 
since I moved out, but my mom hadnt changed a thing. It was like being lost in the 80s. All of my old posters still covered the walls: Howard Jones from his One World Tour, a really cute Julian Lennon head shot, Corey Hart (wearing his sunglasses at night), and a full cast poster of the Kids from Fame (the television series, not the movie). To this day, I still dont know how I got back to my room. When I opened my eyes, Jude was standing 
 89over me, holding a newspaper. 
 
  Nice of you to join the family in our time of need, he said. 
 
  What happened? I asked. 
 
You passed out. Then I remembered that my dad was dead and it wasnt just a 
bad dream.  
Heres the evening edition of the Tampa Times, Jude said, throwing the 
newspaper at me.  
The headline on the front page read: Local Man Dies in Freak Accident as City 
Sanitation Truck Smashes into Area Buckstars. This is what thearticle said: A Tampa resident was killed at the scene of a horrible accident when a city sanitation truck, driven by Mark Tempest, age 30, lost control of its brakes. The truck sped out of control and crashed into the Buckstars Coffee Shop located on Dale Mabry Avenue and Kennedy Boulevard. Henry Robinson, age 48, was the only patron in the coffee shop at the time. 
He was reportedly drinking one of the companys famous non-fat decaf mocha lattes 
when he was struck. Sources at the scene say Robinson may also have been eating a cheese danish, but the pastry has yet to be recovered.

Setting the Scene: 
 
1239 Norway.  Tora and Earl Magnus have married, despite their dislike for each 
other. Tora has just bathed in a forest pond.  Proud and stubborn, she struggles with Magnuss domineering ways and her bewildering longing for his caresses. 
Excerpt from LOVE THY ENEMY:  
 
Magnuss eyes narrowed at her biting reference to their marital arrangement.  Sarcasm doesnt become you, Tora, he admonished. 
 93 
Then I shall use it more often, she quipped. Well, youve gotten your way, 
now give me my clothes! She approached Magnus and reached for her gown.  
He whipped her garments behind his back, his eyes daring her to take them from 
him. Tis very tempting to keep them, he said, his voice rumbling with laughter. He grinned at her. You look angry enough to kill me with the daggers in your eyes! I am glad you are not a man, Tora. Especially at a time like this. He admired her feminine curves.  
A warm tingling built deep within Toras belly and spread under his caressing 
eyes. He held out her clothes to her, but grabbed her when she reached for them. He drew her to him, holding her cool, wet body against his hard warm masculine one. He kissed her deeply and at length, leaving her breathless and trembling. He released her and loosened his clothing. Tora shivered, every nerve poised to flee, but Magnuss steady gaze kept her mesmerized. He drew her down onto the bank with him.  
I should have taken you out here before. The sunlight makes your skin glow as it 
caresses the curve of your breasts and hips, he murmuredin appreciation. His hands and mouth followed the path of the sun and soon Tora lay quivering, her hands clutching his shoulders as he brought her expertly to that exquisite edge of supreme pleasure.

 BLACKBERRY CRISP 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
In COMING HOME , Ann Josephsons  most recent novel from Kensington 
Publishing Company, Jared and Althea enjoy the beauty of a north Georgia mountainside one afternoon as they look for sweet, juicy blackberries. Jared, especially, enjoys remembering simpler times when he picked berries for his mother years earlier. Even the brambles evil thorns cant diminish his pleasure in the pickingor later in the eating. 
 
Excerpt from Coming Home:  
 
As eager as a kid, he grabbed a berry-laden cane and reached for the biggest ripe 
blackberry.  
Ouch, damn it. Hed forgotten about the thorns. Watch out, sweetheart. These 
things stick. 
 95 
She dropped a handful of berries into her container, then reached carefully for 
more. I know.  
Mom used to send me blackberry picking. Id forgotten how scratched up I got. 
Somehow it made the berries sweeter. He picked a berry, plopped it into his mouth, and savored the tart-sweet taste.  
She laughed. You wont have any to take home if you keep eating them, my 
mom used to say. Ow.  
When she stepped back, Jared noticed a cane had attached itself to one leg of her 
thin slacks. Hold on, Ill get it loose.  
It was more easily said than done. Every time Jared got one thorn untangled, 
another managed to embed itself in Altheas pants leg. Finally he freed her, but not before she suffered several more sharp pricks.

 97MOCHA BROWNIES 
 
Setting the Scene: 
 
Inept cook Jill Carey gets some help from the resident ghosts in Bliss House when 
she makes a disaster out of a simple brownie recipe she is trying to make for her lover, Kyle Randall. Heres an excerpt of a lighter moment in Sara Jarrods novel, HEAVENLY 
BLISS , a Berkley Haunting Hearts romance described by bestselling author Susan Wiggs 
as a dark and gritty tale of sexual obsession and the healing power of love.  
Excerpt from Heavenly Bliss: 
 
Look, Ill show you. These brownies may not look perfect, but they taste just 
fine. She used a knife to scrape out a hunk and shoved it into her mouth.  
Ugh, she sputtered, sprinting to the sink to spit out the scorched, bitter morsel 
before rinsing her mouth with water straight from the tap.  
Cyrus chuckled, and Jill silently seconded Kyles suggestion to keep this ghost on 
edge until the last hour of the last day before doing the deed that would set him and Laura free.  
Cyrus Bliss!  Laura appeared beside Jill and encouraged her to drink more 
water, this time from a glass. Leave this poor young lady alone. If she feels she needs to 
learn to cook, I will teach her. Make yourself useful now. Take that pan outside and bury it. My grandson does not need to see it, or this. 
 Jill watched Laura float around the kitchen, gathering up the ingredients she had 
strewn all around and putting them away. Dont, she protested. At least Im able to do that.  
Describe how you made those brownies,  Laura suggested while Jill scrubbed 
damp flour off the floor.  
When Jill obliged her, the ghost shook her head and chuckled . I believe they 
meant you to use brewed coffee, not coffee grounds, my dear.

 99STELLAS 24TH OF JULY CHOCOLATE CHERRY NUT CAKE 
WITH SEVEN MINUTE ICING 
 
Excerpt from This is the Place: 
 
Today was July 24th, the day Brigham Young had entered the Salt Lake Valley 
more than one hundred years before. He knew that his followers would wring this desert to green like the rains bring the Indian Paint Brush and Sego Lilies to bloom. He had said, This is the place. And it was.  
The Garret and Stella Eccles familySkys familywould have gathered on 
their shady lawn on the East side of the house for this reason alone, but as it happened it was also Sky and Venetias birthdays. They celebrated with sparklers instead of candles for that was how the holiday itself was celebrated. These two native Utah women were tied to the state and to each other by accident of birth, place, and timing.  
There was potato salad made with red potatoes with the skins left on. There were 
hot dogs. Cokes were chilling in their bottles in a galvanized steel washtub. It was filled with ice cubes made in little segregated trays. The twin cakes, frosted by hand with seven-minute icing, were on an umbrella table protected from flies with waxed paper. TV trays had been set up next to chairs to handle pop, ashtrays, and bowls of party mix, a recipe that Stella had found in the Ladies Home Journal.  
Neesha knew that in a whileit was as sure to happen as the cutting of the 
cakesthe family would begin to discuss politics, which in Utah is the same as discussing religion. They would bash Mormon beliefs as foolish, the Mormons intensity about converting them as insulting. Sky would fade into another place with practiced ease and Garretthe lone Mormonwould take his broad-toothed grin into the garage to putter with his rock collection or sharpen his tools. 
 
Stellas 24
th of July Chocolate Cherry Nut Cake with Seven Minute Icing 
 
Ingredients: Chocolate Cherry Nut Cake 
1 cup sugar 
1 egg, beaten 1-¾ cup cake flour ¼ cup walnuts or pecans, chopped 2 squares semisweet chocolate ½ cup butter, softened 1 cup sour milk 1 tsp baking soda 5-oz bottle maraschino cherries, sliced 1 pinch salt 1 tsp vanilla 
 
 10050s Seven-Minute Frosting 
Double Boiler 
1-½ cup sugar 1/3 cup water 1 pinch salt 1 T white corn syrup 2 unbeaten egg whites 1 tsp vanilla sseveral Fourth of July sparklers 3 drops blue food coloring if you want a red, white and blue theme  
Instructions: 
For Cake: 
Sift together the sugar, flour, salt, and soda. Melt the chocolate in some of the maraschino 
juice. Add butter, milk, melted chocolate, egg, and vanilla. Mix thoroughly. Add the maraschino cherries and nuts. Dust two 9- to10-inch cake pans with a mixture of flour and chocolate. Divide the batter between the two pans. Bake at 350° F for about 25 minutes. Use a toothpick to test doneness. The toothpick should come out clean. Remove from pans and let cool on rack or waxed paper.  
For Frosting: 
Fill the bottom part of the double boiler with water and bring to a simmer. Combine the 
sugar, water, corn syrup and egg whites in the top of the double boiler. Place the top portion of the double boiler over the bottom and beat the mixture with a rotary beater for 7 to 10 minutes or until peaks form. Remove the double boiler from the heat. Blend the vanilla and food coloring into the mixture. Place one layer of the cooled cake onto a pedestal cake stand. Cover with icing. Place the other layer on top of that and anchor with toothpicks. Ice it using all the frosting. Make little peaks in the frosting on top by pushing the icing with a knife and quickly pulling it upward. Just before serving put two or three sparklers on the cake and light them. 
 
Authors Bio: 
THIS IS THE PLACE  is fiction, but real events were my inspiration. So, when I 
needed recipes for this cookbook, I called my 84-year-old mother in Salt Lake City and had her raid her file box for the original recipes mentioned in it. She sent them to me 
typed in a ragged, red typeface. The typewriter was oldeven back in the 50s and 
refused to allow the fan of lead keys to reach for the black ink on the ribbon. This family partywhere intolerance was passed around as freely as the slices of birthday cakehappened just after I became a staff writer at the Salt Lake Tribune . I also worked as a 
writer for Good Housekeeping Magazine  and Eleanor Lambert Agency, a famous fashion 
publicist in New York. 
 
Carolyn Howard-Johnson  is the author of This Is The Place,  an award-winning 
novel about love, prejudice and redemption set in Utah in the 50s. All of the wonderful recipes she supplied for this cookbook are from her novel, This Is the Place . You are

PEGGYS TASTY COBBLER 
 
Excerpt from From Old to Gold: How to Start and Run an Antiques Business: 
 
Ive always loved antiques. I get attached to old things very easily, be it an old 
quilt that was lovingly sewed by hand, each stitch tiny and even on the various scraps of fabric, or the old toy truck I found as a teenager at a farm auction. And yes, the rust just makes it better.  
I decided as an adult to share my love of antiques with others by finding and 
selling these objects that others love so much too. These treasures remind us of our own past, and of a time when things seemed a little simpler. A quieter time.  This idea, of a time when people moved a little slower and savored the small things, led me to write this book. In todays rushed world, having a hobby that you love that you can develop into a fun business is exciting!  
Peggys Tasty Cobbler 
 
Ingredients: 
Pastry: 
1-1/2 cups flour 
1 tsp sugar ½ tsp salt ½ cup shortening 5 to 6 T ice water  
Fruit Filling: 
12 cups of fruitUse any combination of the following fruits to make a cobbler uniquely 
your own... just be sure to use 12 cups of fruit: Granny Smith apples, sliced and cored; Bartlett pears, sliced and cored; whole fresh or frozen blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries; fresh or frozen rhubarb, chopped into 1-inch pieces 3 cups sugar 1 cup flour 3 T lemon juice 3 T butter ½ cup pecans (if desired)  
Instructions: 
Preheat oven to 350° F. For the pastry, combine flour, sugar, and salt in medium bowl. 
Cut shortening into dry mixture until crumbly. Add 1 T of ice water at a time, mixing with a fork or pastry mixer until pastry forms a ball. Roll out pastry on lightly floured surface to 13 by 12-inch rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick. Cut pastry into desired shapes (Christmas trees for a festive holiday cobbler, stars to celebrate the 4
th of July, you get the 
idea have fun with it). Set pastry aside. 
 102 
For the filling, mix 12 cups of fruit with sugar and flour. Spread filling in 13 by 12-inch pan. Sprinkle fruit with lemon juice, pecans, and butter. Set pastry shapes on top of fruit. Sprinkle with a bit of sugar. Bakefor 60 to 70 minutes or until fruit is bubbly and thickened. Serve warm with ice cream or at room temperature with whipped cream or ice cream. Serve on an assortment of mismatched antique plates. It just tastes better!

Kristie  and her husband have lived in all over the United States and many foreign 
countries while following his career. While living in Japan, Kristie found it very difficult to find books to read that were written in English. This situation was intolerable, as she was an avid reader. In desperation she began writingher own books just to have something to read. She discovered a new passion in writing; thus her career as a romance novelist was born.  
Although Kristie  is originally from the South and still remains Southern at heart, 
she and her husband now reside in a small town in the high desert of Southern Nevada in between international assignments.

GRAM HARRYS HOME-CANNED GARDEN-FRESH RASPBERRY 
JAM 
 
Excerpt from This is the Place:  
 
The Christmas fruit thing came to Stellas closed eyes. It had happened just before 
Stella and Garrets first Christmas as a married couple. The Eccles family was cracking nuts for Harriets infamous fruitcake. Stella was certain that, over the years, more than one molar had been broken on shell fragments in Harriets cake. Stella was trying to pick the sharp debris from the mix in the bowl. 
 
  Hand me the nigger toes. Ill crack those, Bernice had said. 
 
 Stella looked at the bowl, the assorted nuts hard and unyielding in shades of browns, like a bowl full of topaz gems. What.  Which... What are you saying, Bernie? 
 
  Yes. The ones that look like nigger toes. 
 
Theyre called Brazil Nuts, Bernice. Braz-il Nuts. Theres a whole lot in a name 
and these,Stella picked one up between her thumb and forefingerare Brazil Nuts. 
 
  Well, you dont have to take it personally. You arent colored. 
 
No, just not acceptable. Stella remembered that her face felt bloodless and her 
hands tingled. 
 
  Well, this is just like you. Uppity. 
 
Stella picked up her uppity coat from the back of the chair she had been sitting in 
and tilted her heada lets go motionat Garret. Harriet put a bottle of her homemade raspberry jam in Stellas hand.   
 Take this, Harriet said. It will taste real good on your toast in the morning. 
 
Gram Harrys Home-Canned  Garden-Fresh Raspberry Jam 
 
Ingredients: 
2 quarts red raspberries. (Gram Harry picked hers ripe from bushes behind her house.) 
7 cups sugar ½ bottle fruit pectin 1 box canning wax  
 105Instructions:  
Carefully select the best raspberries and wash them. Crush them with a potato masher but 
not so much that some of the little nodules in the berries arent intact. Measure out four cups. If there isnt enough, mash more berries or add water to make up the difference. Add sugar and mix. Bring to full, rolling boil for 1 full minute stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in pectin. Skim the pink froth from the top (you can let the young cooks who want to help with this project taste thistheyll remember it their whole lives!) and pour into hot, sterilized glasses leaving enough room (about ½ inch at least) for the sealing wax.  For a real 50s look, use bottles youve saved from other productspreferably small decorative onesor assorted glasses from your thrift store. Makes eleven 6-oz bottles.  Melt enough wax to cover the tops of each bottle. Pour the hot wax on top of the jam. Make sure the wax touches all the way to the edges of the bottles. Label the outside of the bottles for gift-giving. 
 
Authors Bio: 
 
I dont remember a time when I didnt want to write a novel. I wanted to write 
Gone with the Wind only about Utah instead of the South. I wanted it to say something important and still be entertaining. I wanted to paint an authentic picture of both of my culturesthe Mormon and the Non-Mormonfor one side was very different from, yet very much the sameas the other. I believe that because I was raised with a window open on both religions, I was able to see how intolerance corrodes the soul of both those who practice it and those on whom it is practiced and to show how it turns back on itself in a cycle of destruction.

GRAM HARRYS MUSTARD PICKLES 
 
 109Excerpt from This is the Place:  
 
Sometime around 1920 Gram Harriet sent Dr. Bouchet a bottle of chartreuse 
mustard pickles bobbled with little pearls of pickling onions. He had helped her learn the rhythm method even though they both knew her Mormon religion frowned upon that. With the pickles was a carefully worded thank you note that could not be deciphered too readily if it fell into the wrong hands:  
She may have thought that with people like Dr. Bouchet around, life would be 
easier for her girls. And easier for the granddaughters she surely would someday see on the pages of her familys genealogy records. She probably also knew that there is no better gift in the world than a bottle of her home-made mustard pickles 
 
Gram Harrys Mustard Pickles  Ingredients: 
100 tiny pickling cucumbersGram Harriet picked tiny ones from the vines before early 
frosts threatened to ruin what was left of her summers crop. You should be able to find them in your supermarket toward the end of August but if you live in a big city, you may have to ask your produce manager to order them. They are about 2 inches long. 2 heads cauliflower, also from the garden 2-½ lb pickling onions (these are about ½- to 1-inch in diameter)(Your produce person may have to order these for you, too.) ½ gal. white vinegar ½ lb dry mustard, ground (Gram Harry sometimes ground her own from the seeds that grew wild in the fields near her farm.) One 4- to 8-oz pkg. of pickling spices (These are found in a box on the spice shelf of supermarkets.) 1 cup salt 1 cup sugar 2 T turmeric 1 tsp alum 1 dozen pint canning bottles (Kerr or Ball) or equivalent 1 dozen self-sealing canning lids (Kerr or Ball) A little flour for thickening  
Instructions: 
Break the cauliflower into flowerets. Cut the root end from each tiny onion and peel the 
outer skin from it. As you cry, remember this is a labor of love. Soak the cucumbers, onions, and cauliflower in a brine made with the salt and enough water to cover the vegetables.  The next morning sterilize the canning bottles by boiling in a large kettle of water for at least 5 minutes. Remove from water with tongs and hot pads, being careful not to contaminate the bottle interiors or the lip of the bottles. Let them air dry as you prepare the pickles. Prepare the canning lids for sterilizing as directed on the box. Drain and wash 
 110the vegetables that have been soaking in the brine. Save some of the liquid. Cover them 
with the vinegar and sugar and bring them to a boil. Cook until the cucumbers change from green to brown. Add the pickling spices and mustard. Stir. Dissolve the turmeric in a little water and add to the mixture. Make a thickening paste with some of the vegetable water and flour as you would if you were making gravy. Add it slowly to the liquid on the pickles until it is a little thicker than a rich, maple syrup. Add the alum and stir thoroughly. This is the secret for crisp pickles.  Pack the pickles into the bottles being careful not to contaminate the bottles with utensils or any other unsterile object. Try to put an equal number of pickles, onions, cauliflower, and chartreuse liquid in each bottle. Seal with the canning lids as directed on the box. If you wish, label the bottles with Gram Harrys Mustard Pickles or start a tradition using your own namebut do remember Gram Harry. 
 
Authors Bio: 
 
I was born and raised in Utah and come from a long line of wonderful cooks. For 
some reason, I rarely do it myself. Still, the food enriches my memories. Many of those who live in Utah countryeven Salt Lake Cityhave maintained the household virtues of their pioneer ancestors. Many still hunt deer and pheasant, and fish for fresh rainbow trout in the crystal waters of the Wasatch Mountains. Womeneven those with careersoften sew and quilt and, of course, cook. Summer is still a time when yards are filled not only with petunias but also with tomatoes, zucchinis, and, of course, cucumbers.  
One person who reviewed This is the Place  said that Utah itself was one of the 
major characters. And so it is with my life. It is a place where my roots are but a place where I no longer live or belong. I carry with me a sweet nostalgia for the place whether I am in California with my actor husband or in Utah visiting my 84-year-old mother.
